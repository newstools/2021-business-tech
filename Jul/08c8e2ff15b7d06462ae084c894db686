How do we get our thought leadership articles published? This is one of the most common questions the BusinessTech marketing team receives from South Africa businesses – both big and small. The answer is simple: use online content marketing. Content marketing products allow you to take the thought leadership articles written by your company’s executives and ensure they are read by the right audience. An excellent example of a content marketing product which lets you do this is a sponsored article. Sponsored articles are available from the country’s leading news websites, such as BusinessTech. Key attributes of a good sponsored article are: The article is published to the homepage of the news website.
The article is posted to the news website’s Facebook, LinkedIn, and Twitter pages.
Boosts are applied to the social media posts to allow for audience amplification. The other huge advantage that content marketing offers is that it provides the best return on investment for your advertising spend. Nielsen’s Media ROI report for South Africa states that reading consistently delivers “the greatest ROI for every R1 spent”. This report shows that a marketing investment is maximised when consumers read, absorb, and act upon brand information. This is complemented by the fact digital advertising provides superior return on your marketing spend when compared to print, TV, radio, cinema, and outdoor advertising. This is illustrated in the graphic below.
