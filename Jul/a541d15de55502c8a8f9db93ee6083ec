Overall, out of the total reported industry sales of 38,030 vehicles: 86.3% represented dealer sales;
7.6% represented sales to the vehicle rental industry;
3.9% to industry corporate fleets; and
2.2% sales to the government. The June 2021 new passenger car market at 24,482 units had registered an increase of 5,348 cars, or a gain of 28%, compared to the 19,134 new cars sold in June 2020. The car rental industry accounted for 10.5% of car sales in June Domestic sales of new light commercial vehicles, bakkies and mini-buses at 11,208 units during June 2021 had recorded an increase of 986 units, or a gain of 9.6%, from the 10,222 light commercial vehicles sold during June 2020. “Ongoing stronger sales through the dealer channel signals improved consumer and business sentiment. Rental companies are re-fleeting again, while the delayed replacement cycle – due to lockdown restrictions in 2020 – is catching up in contributing to improved new vehicle sales. “However, of concern is the persistent electricity supply disruptions, port delays, and the third Covid-19 wave of infections being experienced. The vaccine rollout is slow and a third wave of the pandemic threatens to dent the momentum in consumption in the country, especially if the adjusted alert level 4 lockdown restrictions are extended for longer than the initial two-week period,” Naamsa said. “Stock shortages continue to have some impact on overall sales as manufacturers continue to manage demand versus supply on imports and availability of production, while local manufacturing continues to experience some parts supply challenges,” said Gaoaketse. “However, year-to-date sales remain reassuring as the market continues its slow recovery.” Data from Naamsa reveals the best-selling vehicle brands over June, with several affordable models featuring towards the top of the list.
