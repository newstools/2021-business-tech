FNB will open an additional 50 new community branches by 2023 as part of its plans to grow investment in local communities. The bank said that the community branches will be between 70 – 90 square metres in size and will blend self-service and face-to-face interactions. “In the last three years, we’ve opened 14 new branches and revamped over 130 to cater to customer needs via assisted and unassisted channels,” said chief executive Jacques Celliers. “In our points of presence, our aim is to ensure that the right services are available within proximity to our customers. As a result, we have maintained consistent investment in our vast network spanning nearly 600 branches and approximately 5 000 ATMs in local markets across South Africa.” Lee-Anne van Zyl, chief executive of FNB Points of Presence said the introduction of new branches will be supported by ongoing refurbishments, with a further 53 branches scheduled for upgrades in the short-to-medium-term. She added that FNB’s branch network plays an important role in the provision of essential services beyond banking and is part of efforts to help the Department of Home Affairs with the distribution of Smart IDs and passports at selected branches. The service is currently available at a number of branches including: Portside (Cape Town),
Centurion Lifestyle (Pretoria),
Merchant Place (Sandton Johannesburg),
Lynnwood (Pretoria),
Burgersfort (Limpopo)
The Glen (Johannesburg)
Cornubia (KwaZulu-Natal). Since its inception over 267,800 Smart ID cards and passports have been issued to customers in partnership with Home Affairs, FNB said. Customers in provinces where the service is available can apply via the online system of the Department of Home Affairs (DHA) to collect their Smart IDs and Passports at a participating FNB branch.
