At NSN we have a natural affinity for success, as evidenced by the colossal performance of our Accredited ‘Affinity’ Partners in June. Together they signed a combined contract value of just over R2.4M (Av’ contract 24 months). Contact us today to learn more about how our Partner Success Program can support the growth in your business. Working with Partners that have an appetite for great success really helped launch our Affinity Marketing program back in September last year. Structured marketing plans, agreed between our Partners and their Business Development Managers, have really driven great customer engagement campaigns and grown not only our brand but also theirs. Last month we launched a new dimension to the Affinity program: Cascade. Affinity Cascade is open to all and it offers an easy entry point into our Partner Centric universe here at NSN. Our Cascade social media program is designed to support your pathway to success, amplifying your messages, elevating your brand, and generating wider audiences and new business growth. This is an open invitation to engage with our world class marketing team here at NSN and benefit from their knowledge, experience and market winning strategies. Over a series of 4 initial webinars, we will reveal some of our strategies and better ways of working in marketing and social media. We will of course also reveal the core secret of what makes Cascade such a powerful program. Cascade workshops will take place from July 30. Whilst access to our Cascade program is open to businesses that are not currently accredited partners of NSN, we hope to encourage many to join the accredited program. Where Cascade reveals how to create great marketing and grow an audience, the accredited program offers increasing access to our marketing team as your outsources marketing department.
