Dis-Chem Pharmacies on Thursday (1 July) announced the launch of its same-day on-demand delivery service, offering delivery within 60 minutes, and giving customers access to a range of 7,000 items across health, nutrition, beauty, cosmetic and electrical products. The launch of Dis-Chem’s DeliverD service will be trialled in selected stores across Johannesburg and other major metropolitan areas before being extended to other regions aligned to Dis-Chem’s footprint, the retailer said. Initially, a limited range of front shop products – health, nutrition, beauty, cosmetics, electrical and baby ranges – will be available during the trial pilot phase. “Dis-Chem DeliverD complements our existing online offering, and this development taps directly into understanding what our customers want, central to which is convenience. “We have seen significant online growth in the past 12 months and the ongoing customer demand for quick, same-day online service was a key driver behind the introduction of this offering,” said Saul Saltzman, executive director at Dis-Chem. Saltzman said delivery times will depend on customer needs, location and availability of slots. The trial phase will give loyal Dis-Chem customers the opportunity to try the service and provide feedback which, in turn, will allow Dis-Chem to refine the offering. “We foresee the trial phase being a partnership with our customers so that we can ultimately bring the best possible experience and we welcome feedback so that we can refine and improve this service,” Saltzman said. Dis-Chem DeliverD will initially be available to customers situated within 10km of the following stores during the trial:  Athol Oaklands (Blubird)
