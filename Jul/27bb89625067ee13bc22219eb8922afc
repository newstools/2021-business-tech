In the week ended June 27, the country recorded 5,228 deaths compared with 1,729 official deaths from the virus, the South African Medical Research Council said in a report Wednesday. The number of deaths, which is measured against a historical average, was the highest since the week ending Jan. 24 and compared with 4,145 the week earlier. Excess deaths in Gauteng rose to a second consecutive weekly pandemic-era record with the province where one in four South Africans live recording 3,224 more deaths than would normally be expected, Bloomberg said. Still, the seven-day average shows that infections may have peaked in the province. The proportion of national daily infections from Gauteng fell below 50% on Wednesday after climbing to as high as 69% in recent weeks. That indicates that infections are now rising in other regions. Lambda variant While the Delta variant continues to wreak havoc across the country’s healthcare facilities, the World Health Organisation (WHO) has added a ‘Lambda’ variant, also known as C.37, as the seventh and newest “variant of interest”. The NICD said that the Lambda variant is currently increasing in prevalence in South American and other countries, however, it stressed that this variant has not been detected in South Africa.
