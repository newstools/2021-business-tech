He has also played a pivotal role in the global rollout of Discovery Vitality’s Shared-value Insurance model to 19 countries around the world. In this episode of BusinessTalk, Friedlander discusses Discovery Life’s Dollar Life Plan – life insurance that pays out in US dollars and rewards you for getting healthy. But why offshore life cover? Friedlander says globalisation, especially in a post-Covid world, is expected to accelerate, and you need to hedge your protection needs against hard currency. He says that having some diversification is a responsible way to conduct your financial planning. Friedlander says in the investment space, diversification is a given, and yet in risk planning, you are dealing with far more uncertainty and time horizons. He believes that reducing that risk and creating that hedge is arguably more important. Friedlander talks Michael through some of the trends in the life cover space, pointing to an increase in demand for life products in the wake of the global Covid pandemic.
