The National Coronavirus Command Council (NCCC) will meet on Sunday (11 July 2021), to assess developments in the Covid-19 pandemic in the country and the national response to this challenge. “The council’s deliberations come towards the end of a two-week period during which the country has implemented alert level 4 of the coronavirus national state of disaster,” the presidency said in a statement on Friday. “The council meeting will be followed by meetings of the President’s Coordinating Council and Cabinet.” President Cyril Ramaphosa moved South Africa to an adjusted level 4 lockdown on 27 June, introducing strict restrictions on gatherings, the sale of alcohol and a new evening curfew. Ramaphosa said that these restrictions would be reviewed in two weeks time to establish their effectiveness, with an update due on 11 July. South Africa reported 22,910 new cases of Covid-19 on Thursday (8 July), taking the total reported to 2,135,246. Deaths have reached 63,499, while recoveries have climbed to 1,862,900, leaving the country with a balance of 208,847 active cases. The total number of vaccines administered is 4,017,442. While Gauteng continues to be the epicentre of the third wave of Covid-19 infections, Kubayi-Ngubane said that it appears that the country is now reaching its peak in cases. However, she said that there was now concern that the third wave would start to increase in other provinces, including the Western Cape and Limpopo.
