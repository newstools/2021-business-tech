The Barracks, a new upmarket mixed-use development for commercial and residential has been launched in Cape Townâ€™s CBD, with 64 micro-apartments up for sale. The development comprises predominantly studios along with a limited number of one- and two-bedroomed units. Prices range from around R1.7 million for a studio, R2.4 million for one bedroom and R3.8 million for two bedrooms, said Seeff Property Group, who has been appointed to market the units. The development includes the restoration of a historic building and a new, modern building on top, which is a first for the country, said Ross Levin, licensee for Seeff Atlantic Seaboard and City Bowl. The historic warehouse building dates to around 1767 when it was part of the Lutheran Church complex, serving as a military barracks from 1785 and later as a store for wine and wheat. An early 1800s map shows it as a military depot and there are references to it being used as the naval hospital. The first part of the project involved rehabilitating and restoring the historic warehouse including returning the exterior facades along Strand and Bree Streets to the best-known form as referenced from an 1880s photograph from the Cape Archives of the view up Strand Street from the corner of Bree Street. The main entrance has been created on Bree Street with an arcade slicing through the building to link up with the Church courtyard. All the fabric from this slice was salvaged and used to re-instate a part previously demolished. The result is a considerable increase in, and accessibility to the significance of the historic structure, long hidden from view. The modern new building sits as if floating on top of the heavy masonry of the historic building, set back to preserve the signature views of the Lutheran Church and 18th century streetscape, said Seeff. The rooftop will feature a lifestyle centre with amenities such as a pilates/yoga studio, treatment rooms, a refreshment bar, a 12.5 metre lap pool, outdoor decks and greening. Residents and guests can ascend from their apartments below to exercise, stretch or relax and enjoy scenic views of the city, Table Mountain, Signal Hill and the Cape Town Stadium. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-504459" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/TheBarrcks1.png" alt="" width="1012" height="689" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/TheBarrcks1.png 1012w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/TheBarrcks1-300x204.png 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/TheBarrcks1-768x523.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-504477" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/The-Barracks-4-e1625748298675.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="743" /> <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-504473" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/The-Barracks-2-e1625748289881.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="899" /> <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-504471" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/The-Barracks-3-e1625748322506.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="627" /> <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-504475" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/The-Barracks-1-e1625748310639.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="899" /> Read: A look at the 19 square metre micro-apartments for sale in Cape Town
