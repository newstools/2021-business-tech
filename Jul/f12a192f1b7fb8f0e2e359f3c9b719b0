Listed mass retailer of building materials, home improvement and related products, Cashbuild on Wednesday (14 July) highlighted the damage caused to its outlets and operations mainly in Gauteng and KwaZulu-Natal from the ongoing violent protests and looting in South Africa. As of this morning (14 July), a total of 36 stores – 32 Cashbuild and 4 P&L Hardware stores – have been damaged and looted and are currently unable to trade, it said in a statement. The group has 317 stores – 258 Cashbuild, 58 P&L Hardware and 1 Cashbuild DIY – countrywide.  “Cashbuild has insurance cover in place for such events to minimise losses to the Group. Although higher yesterday, 33 stores remain closed today as a precautionary measure to prevent further damage. This will be continuously reassessed as the situation in the country normalises. “Cashbuild will hereafter initiate a process of rebuilding, restoring and restocking the affected stores for trading which, dependant on the nature and extent of the damage, will determine the timeline to reopen,” it said. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-506040" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Cashbuild.png" alt="" width="794" height="535" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Cashbuild.png 794w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Cashbuild-300x202.png 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Cashbuild-768x517.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> Read: Looters, gangsters and the ‘third force’ – the disturbing root of South Africa’s violent riots
