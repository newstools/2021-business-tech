Financial services group, FNB has launched a new set of digital tools enabling individual and business customers to manage and update their information and ensure compliance via its trusted and secure financial services platform. As data privacy and protection continues to gain prominence globally, FNB customers will now be able to access the ‘MyProfile’ – for individuals, and ‘Business Profile’ solutions digitally through the FNB App and Online Banking. Once logged in, customers can access the secure MyProfile or Business Profile tool to check and update their personal and contact information, update their address details using the location finder technology on their mobile device, and then instantly verify identity details with the Department of Home Affairs. These management tools go beyond being merely an online information updating system, but also provide many other benefits to FNB customers, the bank said. In addition to the convenience of being able to instantly and securely keep their personal or business details up to date, without the need for time-consuming paperwork or queuing, the bank has up-to-date information needed to provide them with the most appropriate, personalised solutions for their needs, without any delays due to non-compliance with current or future know-your-customer regulations. “Today, more than ever before, consumers and business owners need assurance that their information is protected and secure, but also that it is correct,” said FNB chief executive Jacques Celliers, “We believe that there is no better way to provide our customers with that sense of security and confidence than by putting them in full and secure control of their personal and business information.” Read: FNB to revamp 53 branches with new technology – here’s what they look like
