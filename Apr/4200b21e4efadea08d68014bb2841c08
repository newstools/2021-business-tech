Retailer Woolworths says it will scrap single-use plastics at 52 additional stores in Gauteng, the Western Cape and the North West, as part of its campaign to make all its packaging reusable or recyclable – by the end of April. The additional stores take the total number of outlets that have dropped single-use plastics to over 200. The move comes as part of the group’s vision to have zero packaging waste-to-landfill, and for all packaging to be reusable or recyclable by 2022. To reach this goal, first announced in 2018, Woolworths said it has made ‘positive changes’ in stores, by using less packaging, less plastic material in packaging and ensuring that all out packaging is recyclable. It said that the recent rollout of the new avocado packaging to all varieties sees the polystyrene plastic punnet being replaced with a kraft box base made from 63% recycled paper which equates to an annual plastic saving of between 35 – 40 tons and is covered with a fully recyclable shrink wrap. “We are confident that the new packaging will deliver the functionality that we need. Kraft board is an excellent packaging alternative to plastic in that it is 100% fully recyclable, biodegradable, Forest Stewardship Council ® (FSC N002141) certified and locally-sourced,” Woolworths said. Previous changes made by the group include: Packaging in its specialty range of tomatoes now comes in a fully recyclable kraft tray made from 65% recycled paper, and a polypropylene lid. These changes resulted in 20 g less plastic per pack or 77 tonnes less plastic, per year from going to landfill.
Redesigning most long life herbs & spices packaging, saving 364 tonnes of packaging from going to landfill.
Replacing part of its to-go plastic packaging with recyclable paper board, printing directly on the board. Now 5.9 million fewer labels and 32 tonnes less plastic end up in landfill.
Introducing a fully-recyclable Earth Friendly range, with all products containing a minimum of 25% recycled plastic
Various home care products that now come in 100% recycled plastic bottles The group is trying to wean shoppers off using single-use plastic bags, with stores across the country adopting a plastic-free policy. The policy was launched at 29 stores, with a further 121 outlets joining the campaign in November 2020. Woolworth has 452 food stores and 279 fashion, beauty and home stores across the country. Shoppers at these stores will not be able to purchase plastic bags at till points, and will have to either bring their own bags with them, or purchase longer-term multi-use options in-store, it said.
