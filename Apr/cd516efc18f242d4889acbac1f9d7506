Embattled power utility Eskom says it will commence its regular wage talks with the company’s recognised labour representative unions starting on 4 May 2021. In a statement on Friday, Eskom said that the wage talks may be unpredictable and, depending on the positions taken by the parties, could result in ‘tensions arising’. “Eskom would like to assure the public that it will do everything possible to attempt to reach consensus that is financially sustainable and in the best interest of its employees, the public and the country at large. “If disruptions were to occur, these may have a negative impact on our infrastructure and operations, which may compromise our ability to supply electricity.” During the talks in the Central Bargaining Forum, Eskom said it will engage with the National Union of Mineworkers (NUM), the National Union of Metalworkers of South Africa (NUMSA) and Solidarity to determine the conditions of employment and wages for all non-managerial employees. The unions are the recognised labour representatives of Eskom’s Bargaining Unit employees. “Eskom will be approaching the talks in good faith, with the best interests of the company, its employees and the country at heart. “We would like to appeal to all the parties to the talks to conduct themselves in a manner that puts respect for the law, best interests of the country and its citizens first, and to do everything possible to avoid any unnecessary disturbances. “This is particularly crucial as Eskom is, by law, providing a critical essential service.”  Read: Schools and other government buildings in South Africa to be solar powered: minister
