6. Enter your OTP, and you’re done! Once you’ve purchased your voucher, you will receive an email confirmation within a few minutes. You can then either redeem it or gift it to someone special. “Electronic vouchers are all about convenience. There’s no need to purchase vouchers in-store and overstuff your wallet, and since you don’t have to link your credit or debit card to a third-party website, it also reduces the risk of online fraud,” van der Hoven concludes.
