The Road Traffic Management Corporation (RTMC) says that motorists who have a driver’s licence being processed by the traffic department can check the progress of the application via its online web portal. To check the status of your licence, access the web page, enter your ID number and additional details, and the National Traffic Information System (Natis) will return the necessary information. Transport minister Fikile Mbalula has admitted to a massive backlog in the system, citing corruption among back-office staff at driving licence testing centres (DLTCs) as a concern. This backlog was exacerbated by the Covid-19 pandemic and national lockdown, which shut down many of the normal services and operating hours. The RTMC has also come under fire for delays, particularly around its online booking system. The online system was first introduced in 2018 as a means of cutting down on long queues and eliminating corruption. However, it has faced a number of complaints around difficulties to book slots and system downtime. Government has granted motorists some reprieve, however, with the last gazette around licencing – published in December – extending the grace period for expired permits. Currently, all learner’s licences, driving licence cards, temporary driving licences and professional driving permits that expired between 26 March and 31 December 2020 are still deemed to be valid and will remain valid until 31 August 2021. This, however, excludes vehicle licence disks. “License discs were not included. The extension was created to open up space for all types of license renewals, updates and makes at DLTCs responding to the backlog created by the lockdown period,” the department said in a statement.
