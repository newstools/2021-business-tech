Positioning your company and its executives as thought leaders in your industry is crucial to business growth. A proven way to do this is by using thought leadership content – specifically articles and video interviews. BusinessTech has seen a strong increase in the number of South African companies looking to publish thought leadership content on our channels. The two most popular options are sponsored articles and Business Talk  interviews. Sponsored articles are an excellent way to educate and inform your audience, and a well-written thought leadership piece by an executive can have a big impact on their standing in the market.
