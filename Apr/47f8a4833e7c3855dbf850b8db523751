Huawei’s FreeBuds 4i True Wireless Stereo (TWS) earbuds are now available to purchase in South Africa. These earbuds offer amazing sound quality and an innovative design, making them a great choice if you are looking for a high-end audio experience. Click here to buy the Huawei FreeBuds 4i from the Huawei online store. Priced at just R1,499, the FreeBuds 4i are also some of the best value-for-money earbuds available in South Africa. The FreeBuds 4i use the latest audio technologies to create an immersive audio experience. The sound profile of these earbuds is remarkable, offering strong bass (powered by a 10mm large dynamic driver), balanced treble, and accurate tuning. Therefore, whether you are watching your favourite movies, conducting a business call, or listening to your favourite songs, the FreeBuds 4i will make the experience incredible. This fantastic audio experience is amplified by the fact that these earbuds offer an important feature that is uncommon in this price range – true Active Noise Cancellation (ANC). True ANC uses microphones to detect ambient noise and algorithms to build inverted sound waves that cancel these noises out. This means that you will be able to shut out the outside world and focus all your attention on the audio from your FreeBuds 4i. Huawei is known for its intuitive designs, and the FreeBuds 4i earbuds are no exception. The earbuds are sleek and stylish, meaning they’ll fit in with whatever fashion look you’re going for. They are also incredibly light, and are easy to carry around with you.
Importantly, they are comfortable – and this can be attributed to the true-to-life ear canal calibration that Huawei used to design the earbuds. Huawei has then packed an impressive battery life into these earphones. They are capable of up to 10 hours of audio playback on a full charge, and if you run out of battery a 10-minute fast charge will provide a further 4 hours of playback. The Huawei FreeBuds 4i are now available both on the Huawei online store and from Vodacom as part of a special deal where you will get a free protective cover valued at R199 and a three-month Huawei Music subscription worth R180. Vodacom customers can also add the Huawei FreeBuds 4i to selected contracts for just R49 per month x 24. Click here to buy the Huawei FreeBuds 4i from the Huawei online store.
