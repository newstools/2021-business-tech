Amazon Web Services (AWS) has opened applications for its Equity Equivalent Investment Program (EEIP) in South Africa. EEIPs are South African Department of Trade, Industry and Competition (DTIC) approved initiatives, aimed at providing multinational companies an opportunity to take part in local societal development and contribute towards economic advancement and inclusion of black people and black-owned businesses in South Africa. The program is open to qualifying small businesses in South Africa who want to become AWS partners in the public and commercial sectors. “The AWS EEIP is an 18- to 24-month enablement and acceleration program for businesses with a turnover under R50 million,” the group said. “The program is designed to help these businesses onboard to AWS and accelerate their journey to becoming select and advanced tier consulting or technology partners on the AWS Partner Network (APN).” AWS said that the program will give businesses a range of resources and support not only to achieve partner requirements but build sustainable, scalable businesses which contribute to South Africa’s skills development and job creation imperative. By participating in the program, SMEs get advisory and technical support including: The AWS Partner Transformation Program (PTP); a comprehensive assessment, training, and enablement program focused on helping partners build a successful and profitable AWS Cloud business;
Cloud Center of Excellence bootcamps and enterprise development consulting, which can help partners operationalize their PTP;
Headcount subsidies, which give partners much needed financial support to hire and expand teams;
AWS Training and Certification;
Cash grants to pay for operating expenses, go-to-market funding, AWS Promotional Credit, and fully subsidized APN fees. Read: Government wants a new state-owned company in South Africa – to focus on data and networking
