Technology services company EOH on Wednesday (14 April) published its unaudited results for the six months ended January 2021, showing an operating profit of R59 million, up from a prior R915 million loss. Revenue, however, declined 29% to R4.376 billion from R6.194 billion before. EOH chief executive officer, Stephen van Coller said that the decline is a result of the strategic disposal of non-core assets and exit of under-performing businesses. He said after this disposal EOH is a more sustainable business delivering better quality earnings. “We have seen a significant reduction in one-off costs and are confident that our legacy issues are now under control,” said Van Coller. While the local and global economy remains constrained – with a negative impact on EOH’s clients – the chief executive pointed to some green shoots. “We have seen increased cloud uptake and spend on automation and application development in line with global trends,” he said.  <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-482997" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/EOH.png" alt="" width="774" height="203" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/EOH.png 774w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/EOH-300x79.png 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/EOH-768x201.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> Highlights of EOH’s results: Revenue of R4.376 billion;

The investigation found R1.2 billion worth of dodgy transactions at the company, mostly involving transactions within the public sector contracts. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-483005" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/EOH-1.png" alt="" width="758" height="453" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/EOH-1.png 758w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/EOH-1-300x179.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> Read: EOH boss talks up turnaround progress
