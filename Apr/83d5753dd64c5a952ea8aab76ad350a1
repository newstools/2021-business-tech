Toyota has announced its 2021 Prius model for South Africa, which starts at R566,400. The updated Prius will come with a 1.8-litre Hybrid powertrain that combines an electric motor with Toyota’s 4-cylinder Atkinson cycle engine for a total system output of 90kW. A dedicated EV-mode enables the vehicle to operate under full-electric power. The Prius is classified as a Full Hybrid (FHEV) and uses a self-charging powertrain to provide electric energy. During deceleration or braking, regenerative energy is captured and stored in the battery. This allows the Prius to operate solely on either the petrol engine, the electric motor, or a combination of the two if required. The petrol engine in turn is capable of directly charging the battery pack in the absence of regenerative braking. Power is transmitted to the front wheels via an integrated CVT transmission. <img class="size-full wp-image-483239 aligncenter" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Prius-7.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="667" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Prius-7.jpg 1000w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Prius-7-300x200.jpg 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Prius-7-768x512.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> <img class="size-full wp-image-483233 aligncenter" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Prius-3.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="667" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Prius-3.jpg 1000w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Prius-3-300x200.jpg 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Prius-3-768x512.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> <img class="size-full wp-image-483235 aligncenter" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Prius-2.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="667" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Prius-2.jpg 1000w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Prius-2-300x200.jpg 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Prius-2-768x512.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> Safety The group said that the Prius has been outfitted with some notable upgrades and enhancements to align with other premium Toyota models.
