Nedbank, in collaboration with Mastercard and Ukheshe, has launched its Money Message service – a payment platform that lets small and micro-businesses receive secure in-chat payments from their customers via WhatsApp. The bank said that the service is a first in South Africa, and will allow merchants to send an invoice requesting a payment from any customer through WhatsApp. Customers in turn can then settle a payment directly from the platform. How it works Nedbank said that anyone with a valid South African identity document and South African bank account can access Money Message. Merchants will need to first register for the service, and afterwards they can immediately initiate a payment request. The process should take only a few minutes, the bank said. The business owner sends a request-to-pay message to the customer and for first-time users, a notification is sent via SMS prompting them to register for the service. The customer enters their name, surname and registers their card details to make the payment securely. Customers can make secure, card-less payments via their cellphone numbers or QR codes. Nedbank said the service differentiates itself from similar offerings by other banking and financial groups by being specifically developed to process payments for merchants and small businesses. A beta version of Money Message has been available to a small selection of micro-merchants for just over a month and will gradually reach the broader market during the rest of the year. To register, Nedbank said that users should save Money Message’s number, +27 (0)87 240 6272, as a contact on their phone and start a chat in WhatsApp by sending the word ‘Hi’.
