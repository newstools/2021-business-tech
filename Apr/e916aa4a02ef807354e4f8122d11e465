Jobs portal CareerJunction has published its latest index for March 2021, showing the job skills that are currently in high-demand among employers in South Africa. The CareerJunction Index (CJI) represents online labour dynamics in the country by providing a detailed analysis of the relative ratio of supply and demand in the online job market. It is based on the analysis of  data gathered from the CareerJunction website – where around 3,000 of the country’s top recruiters advertise their positions to millions of registered job seekers. In March, the job search activity increased by 8%, the group said, while recruitment activity grew by 6.9%. As a result, the CareerJunction Index settled at 99 index points. An index score below 100 means that there are more job seekers than job opportunities, and reflects a more competitive environment for those looking for work. CareerJunction said its data showed that recruitment activity has increased for professionals in ICT, warehousing & logistics, sales and finance during the first quarter of 2021. The ‘big three’ skills remain most in-demand, having featured on the index for the last year. This includes software development, where demand increased by 20% during March. Over 1,000 vacancies put up by recruiters or employers in the month require programming or development skills, it said. Middle and department managers also remain high in demand. Currently, finance managers as well as business development managers and sales managers are particularly sought-after. The last of the big three is representative or sales consulting, CareerJunction said. “Demand for sales consultants has been increasing during the first quarter of 2021. Since January hiring activity for sales consultants increased by 16%,” it said.

The IT, business & management and finance sectors are undoubtedly the most sought-after sectors, followed by the sales, admin, office & support and architecture & engineering sectors, among others listed. When looking at active job seekers across various sectors (supply), areas of high supply correlate closely to areas of high demand, however supply outstrips demand in some areas, leading to a competitive environment for job seekers, CareerJunction said. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-483577" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Supply-Demand-March.png" alt="" width="479" height="895" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Supply-Demand-March.png 479w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Supply-Demand-March-161x300.png 161w" sizes="(max-width: 479px) 85vw, 479px" /> Across the sectors, CareerJunction noted that recruitment activity has increased for professionals in ICT, warehousing & logistics, sales and finance during the first quarter of 2021. However, despite an overall uptake in hiring activity, demand seems very volatile for professionals in admin, office & support, architecture & engineering, medical & health, marketing, business & management as well as manufacturing & assembly, it said.
