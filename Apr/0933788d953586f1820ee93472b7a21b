The first guests on the show include Peterjohn Bishop – Sage VP of Partners, Accountants, and Alliance for Africa and the Middle East – and Viresh Harduth, who is the Sage VP of Small Business for the same region. The series will be available on several platforms so that users can choose the one that suits them best. These platforms include YouTube, Facebook, and the Business Talk website.
