Transportation company FedEx Express, a subsidiary of FedEx, has launched its new state-of-the-art facility in Johannesburg, near the OR Tambo International Airport. The new Southern Africa hub consolidates three facilities into a single location, and will serve as the main hub to meet growing customer demand across the region, the group said. The new facility has more than 6,000 sqm dedicated to operations and warehousing, and more than 11,000 sqm of office space. To process the volume of shipments that come through Johannesburg, the facility includes automated sorting technology that can process up to 6,000 packages per hour. It has in-station vehicle loading, allowing 65 vehicles to be loaded at the same time, direct from the sorting lines. FedEx said that the building also has number of sustainability features. To conserve energy, motion detectors activate energy-saving lights only when rooms are occupied. Multiple water-storage tanks around the property collect rainwater, reducing reliance on municipal water sources, which is then recycled to cool the heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning system, and to sustain the building’s garden, which is planted with more than 30 species of indigenous and water-sensitive plants. The FedEx Express Southern Africa Road Network (SARN) will also now operate from this location, with a fleet of more than 40 longer-haul delivery vehicles carrying essential goods, trade items, and customer goods on the domestic and cross-border routes each day. “The building’s location near OR Tambo International Airport, where the FedEx Express all-cargo flight operates from, means closer proximity to the major shopping centre of Johannesburg’s East Rand,” said Taarek Hinedi, vice president operations for Africa and the Middle East at FedEx Express. “Customers can shop from the mall and easily ship to anywhere in South Africa and around the world.” Read: Takealot competitor Everyshop launches in South Africa
