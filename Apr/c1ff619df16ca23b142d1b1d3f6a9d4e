Legal firm Cliffe Dekker Hofmeyr said that companies must ensure that their business practices and the way they interact with customers, clients or consumers adhere to the requisite privacy laws, as well as confirming that the way they collect, store or process their employees’ information aligns with the protections set out in POPIA. The firm has also provided a POPIA compliance checklist which aims to assist businesses. It added that POPIA applies to both public and private bodies) with a general heat map to check its compliance levels and areas of risk relating to POPIA compliance and has merely been provided to assist in expediting the POPIA compliance process. “The checklist does not make provision for every eventuality and serves only as a useful guide to assist businesses to start focusing on the most common instances where businesses need to be POPIA compliant,” Cliffe Dekker Hofmeyr said. “The checklist should in no way to be construed as a substitute for seeking legal advice to ensure that your business is fully compliant with the requirements of POPIA.” Preliminary steps <img class="size-full wp-image-481849 aligncenter" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Preliminary-steps.jpg" alt="" width="750" height="905" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Preliminary-steps.jpg 750w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Preliminary-steps-249x300.jpg 249w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> Dealing with information in your possession <img class="size-full wp-image-481851 aligncenter" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Dealing.jpg" alt="" width="750" height="629" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Dealing.jpg 750w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Dealing-300x252.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> Obtaining and processing information <img class="size-full wp-image-481855 aligncenter" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Obtaining.jpg" alt="" width="750" height="615" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Obtaining.jpg 750w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Obtaining-300x246.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> Requests for access, correction and deletion <img class="size-full wp-image-481857 aligncenter" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Requests.jpg" alt="" width="750" height="502" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Requests.jpg 750w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Requests-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> Direct marketing <img class="size-full wp-image-481859 aligncenter" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Direct-marketing.jpg" alt="" width="750" height="477" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Direct-marketing.jpg 750w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Direct-marketing-300x191.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> Cross-border transfers <img class="size-full wp-image-481861 aligncenter" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Cross-border.jpg" alt="" width="750" height="363" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Cross-border.jpg 750w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Cross-border-300x145.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> List of useful definitions <img class="size-full wp-image-481863 aligncenter" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Definitions.jpg" alt="" width="750" height="927" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Definitions.jpg 750w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Definitions-243x300.jpg 243w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> Commentary by Lucinde Rhoodie (director), Kara Meiring (candidate attorney), Ngeti Dlamini (senior associate), and Preeta Bhagattjee (director).
