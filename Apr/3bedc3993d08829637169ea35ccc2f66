Food Lover’s Market has announced expansion plans for 2021 which will see the grocery retailer spend R250 million on a number of new locations and refurbish older format stores. This includes the newly-opened flagship Food Lover’s Market Waterfall Ridge in Midrand which boasts an updated retail design and a number of new features, it said. “Design enhancements include wide aisles and dedicated food stations dotted around the store, constant stock rotation to maintain freshness and quality, and a focus on unique must-try products,” Food Lover’s said. “Departments are designed as dedicated destination areas, offering customers a Theatre-of-Food experience within the supermarket environment.” <img class="size-full wp-image-485397 aligncenter" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Waterfall-Ridge.jpg" alt="" width="867" height="1300" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Waterfall-Ridge.jpg 867w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Waterfall-Ridge-200x300.jpg 200w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Waterfall-Ridge-683x1024.jpg 683w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Waterfall-Ridge-768x1152.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> <img class="size-full wp-image-485399 aligncenter" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Waterfall-Ridge-3.jpg" alt="" width="1300" height="867" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Waterfall-Ridge-3.jpg 1300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Waterfall-Ridge-3-300x200.jpg 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Waterfall-Ridge-3-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Waterfall-Ridge-3-768x512.jpg 768w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Waterfall-Ridge-3-1200x800.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> <img class="size-full wp-image-485401 aligncenter" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Waterfall-Ridge-2.jpg" alt="" width="868" height="1300" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Waterfall-Ridge-2.jpg 868w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Waterfall-Ridge-2-200x300.jpg 200w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Waterfall-Ridge-2-684x1024.jpg 684w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Waterfall-Ridge-2-768x1150.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> The store includes an expanded grocery department, offering all the household grocery items, a 800 sqm Market Liquors, and a Bloom Market which specialises in flowers and gifts.
