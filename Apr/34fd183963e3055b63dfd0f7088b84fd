Taxpayers will face increased scrutiny from the South African Revenue Service (SARS) as it has effectively lowered the threshold to criminally prosecute taxpayers. Prior to the latest tax amendment legislation becoming final, a taxpayer could only be liable for a fine or subject to imprisonment if the relevant transgression was committed “wilfully and without just cause”. Doelie Lessing, director at Werksmans Attorneys, said that the proposed amendments were met with fierce resistance and were severely criticised by tax practitioners and civil society on the basis that the removal of the element of wilfulness would result in the erosion of the protections against the criminalisation of unintentional mistakes by taxpayers. This is because the proposed amendments would have effectively removed SARS’ obligation to prove intention before a taxpayer could be found guilty of these non-compliance offences. Lessing said that the final amendment legislation has not done away with intent entirely, but rather a differentiated approach has been adopted in terms of which the existing list of non-compliance offences has been split into two categories: Offences that require wilfulness, where the heavier burden of proof falls on SARS;
Offences in respect of which “negligence” will suffice to trigger potential criminal liability. Lessing outlined the different categories of offences in more detail below. Read: SARS wants a closer look at the ‘R400 billion’ South Africans have stashed overseas
