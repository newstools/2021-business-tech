Transport minister Fikile Mbalula has provided a breakdown of the revenue generated by the N3 toll route between Johannesburg and Durban every month. Responding in a recent written parliamentary Q&A, Mbalula said that toll revenue along the route is derived as follows: Sanral (Marrianhill toll plaza) – This is a state toll road driven by government with no profit objective; N3TC Concession (De Hoek Plaza, Wilge Plaza, Tugela Plaza, Mooi River Plaza and associated ramp plazas.) – This is a 30-year concession with the private sector to secure off balance sheet funding and investment into infrastructure, with the associated private sector investor return on investment (ROI) objectives. Returns are however regulated through a concession agreement. When looking at these combined amounts, Mbalula said that the route collected R2.3 billion in the 2019/20 audited financial year. The month which collected the most in tolls was October at R204 million. By comparison, January 2019 saw the least money collected at R174 million. He explained that the 2020/21 audited figures are not yet available as they are still being audited, but are expected to be approximately 25% lower due to the Covid-19 pandemic. <img class="size-full wp-image-480171 aligncenter" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Collected.jpg" alt="" width="627" height="402" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Collected.jpg 627w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Collected-300x192.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> Mbalula said that toll income from toll roads are used for the following purposes: Repay the debt raised to fund the capital cost of the initial road construction works and other major capital costs implemented during the life of the project (typically 30 years) to ensure that there is sufficient road capacity to cater for increasing traffic demand; Cover the cost of road maintenance including pavement rehabilitation and resurfacing to ensure the economic sustainability of this crucial national asset over the life of the project; Operation and maintenance of the toll collection system, including the toll plazas over the life of the project; Undertake routine maintenance including grass cutting, minor road repairs, road marking and signage over the life of the project; Provide route patrols including incident management, emergency response and road user assistance over the life of the project.
