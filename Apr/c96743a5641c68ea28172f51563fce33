In September 2020, HPE launched GreenLake, their as-a-service model to help channel partners drive more growth. Recent stats confirm that the channel plays a significant role in HPE’s business, and an average of 80 percent of indirect business goes through distribution partners. In certain markets, 100 percent of indirect business is filtered through distributors. That’s good news if you are an IT partner in South Africa.
