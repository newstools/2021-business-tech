The South African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC) is facing an uphill battle in collecting TV licence fees, as it has seen a decline in both business and domestic licence payments over the last year. In February 2021, SABC chief financial officer Yolande van Biljon revealed that only 2.5 million of 9.5 million TV licence holders on its database paid their TV licence fees in 2020. The SABC billed around R3 billion in TV licence fees per year but was only able to collect around R791 million. What is even more telling is that only 68,000 of the 401,000 new TV licence holders in 2019 renewed their licences a year later. While the SABC deals with this issue of non-compliance, it is possible to outright cancel your TV licence if you no longer have a television in your home. How to cancel A BusinessTech reader said that they recently emailed the SABC to inform them that they no longer have a television set and that would like to have the licence cancelled. In response, the SABC said that a sworn statement is required with the following information before the licence would be cancelled: The date from which the television set is no longer in use or possession; An explanation of what has become of the television set that was previously licenced by the holder; If the television set was sold or donated as a gift, TV Licences require the new owner’s particulars (surname, initials, ID number and address) as well as their TV licence number, if applicable; If the television set was stolen, provide the case number under which the theft was reported to the police; If the television set was repossessed, the name of the store and the manager’s signature or a store stamp is required; Since many households have more than one television set, confirmation is also required that apart from the set in respect of which this cancellation has been requested, no other TV set is in possession. In terms of South Africa’s broadcasting regulations, a person must have a valid (paid-up) television licence if they use or possess a television set. This includes a TV monitor – without receiving capabilities – that is able to receive a broadcast signal by virtue of being connected to any television receiving equipment such as digital box/decoder, DVD or PC etc. A licence currently costs R265.00 per year, which amounts to approximately 73 cents a day. Concessionary licence holders only pay R74 a year. This includes people over the age of 70 and recipients of a social grant (old-age or disability) from the Department of Social Development. All notices, applications, and queries for exemptions and the concessionary licence can be addressed to the following channels: Post – The Manager, Television Licenses, SABC, Private Bag X60, Auckland Park 2006
