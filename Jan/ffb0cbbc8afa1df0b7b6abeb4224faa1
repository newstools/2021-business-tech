Data from market intelligence and advisory group International Data Corporation (IDC), shows that the global smartphone market continued to improve in the holiday quarter of 2020 (4Q20) with 4.3% year-over-year growth. According to preliminary data from the IDC Worldwide Quarterly Mobile Phone Tracker, smartphone vendors shipped a total of 385.9 million devices during the quarter. While the full year 2020 declined 5.9% compared to 2019, the progress toward market recovery has been impressive and IDC believes the momentum heading into 2021 will remain strong. “There are a lot of elements at play that are fuelling the smartphone market recovery – pent-up demand, continued supply push on 5G, aggressive promotions, and the popularity of low to mid-priced phones,” said Nabila Popal, research director with IDC’s Worldwide Mobile Device Trackers. “Vendors also seem to be better prepared for the second lockdown, ensuring they have the right channel set up ready to fulfil orders and reach the end consumer. “Lockdowns also have people spending less on areas like leisure, travel, and dining out – and smartphones are benefitting from this. In addition to all these factors, the fast recovery and resilience of the smartphone supply chain also has to be given some credit.” <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-464198" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/IDC.png" alt="" width="1302" height="509" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/IDC.png 1302w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/IDC-300x117.png 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/IDC-1024x400.png 1024w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/IDC-768x300.png 768w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/IDC-1200x469.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> In terms of vendors, there was a clear shift among the top five. Apple delivered a phenomenal performance in 4Q20, returning to the number one position with 90.1 million devices shipped, driven by the success of the iPhone 12 series. This represents the highest shipment volume from a vendor in a single quarter and resulted in 23.4% market share and 22.2% year-over-year growth. Samsung moved to number two with 73.9 million device shipments and 19.1% market share. With the continued success of the A series and growth in nearly every region, Samsung saw year-over-year growth of 6.2%. Xiaomi finished the quarter in the third position with shipments of 43.3 million and 11.2% market share while OPPO was fourth with shipments of 33.8 million and 8.8% market share. Both companies successfully capitalised on declining Huawei shipments, growing 32.0% and 10.7% year over year respectively, by focusing on aggressive product portfolios and building partnerships. Huawei fell to the number five spot with shipments of 32.3 million and 8.4% market share. The company continues to suffer under the weight of US sanctions and saw a dramatic year-over-year decline of 42.4%. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-464200" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/IDC1.png" alt="" width="1296" height="502" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/IDC1.png 1296w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/IDC1-300x116.png 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/IDC1-1024x397.png 1024w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/IDC1-768x297.png 768w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/IDC1-1200x465.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> “The recovery of both the smartphone market and its supply chain has been truly impressive and the year-end growth is testament to how far we’ve come,” said Ryan Reith, program vice president with IDC’s Worldwide Mobile Device Trackers. “The majority of the world is either in some form of lockdown or still waiting to return to normal day-to-day life, yet smartphone sales are rebounding as though nothing ever happened.” Read: Xiaomi has moved ahead of Apple in global smartphone sales
