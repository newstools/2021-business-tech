In excess of 106,000 deaths were reported in South Africa in the period between 3 May 2020 and 16 January 2021, indicating that fatalities caused by the Covid-19 pandemic could be much higher than official statistics show. The data from the South African Medical Research Council (SAMRC) is based on deaths recorded on the National Population Register are provided to the SAMRC on a weekly basis. These have been scaled up to estimate the actual number of deaths by accounting for the people who are not on the population register and the under-registration of deaths. The estimated numbers are compared with the number that would be expected based on the historical data from 2018 and 2019. While the excess deaths may not have been directly caused by a Covid-19 infection, issues such as hospital overcrowding and lack of resources caused by the pandemic likely contributed to this high number. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-463172" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Deaths-1.png" alt="" width="1200" height="1220" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Deaths-1.png 707w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Deaths-1-295x300.png 295w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> More recent data shows that there were 13,766 excess deaths of persons from natural causes in the first week of January (3 – 9 January 2021), which increased to 16,093 in the second week (10 -16 January 2021).
