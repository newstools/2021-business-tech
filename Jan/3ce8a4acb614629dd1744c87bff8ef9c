Peugeot Citroen South Africa (PCSA) has announced the official incorporation of the Opel brand into its stable. This means that PCSA has become the official distributor of Opel vehicles in South Africa. PCSA, which is a wholly owned subsidiary of Stellantis, currently distributes Peugeot and Citroen vehicles in country. Opel will now become the third Stellantis brand to be distributed by PCSA. “It is a natural progression, as the three brands complement each other, each appealing to a specific customer profile,” said Leslie Ramsoomar, managing director of Peugeot Citroen South Africa “In addition, it allows our multi-brand dealers to have a single point of contact with the OEM.” PCSA said it has been very clear in its approach to the Opel Brand, assuring dealers and customers and that the impact to them should be minimal, with no immediate changes planned to the existing dealer network. “One of our focus areas for this year is training, with an emphasis on quality and customer service” said Ramsoomar,” working with the existing dealer network”. New Corsa As part of the announcement, PCSA said that the new sixth-generation Opel Corsa will be available at dealerships across South Africa from mid-January this year. The new Corsa features a three-cylinder 1.2 litre petrol engine, which generates 55kW of power and 118 Nm of torque. Drivers can expect a fuel economy of around 5.8 litres/100km. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-462280" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/my20_corsa-edition_rs_red_parked_880x500.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="668" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/my20_corsa-edition_rs_red_parked_880x500.jpg 749w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/my20_corsa-edition_rs_red_parked_880x500-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> <img class="aligncenter wp-image-462284" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/my20_corsa-edition_3qfr_red_driving_880x500.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="668" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/my20_corsa-edition_3qfr_red_driving_880x500.jpg 749w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/my20_corsa-edition_3qfr_red_driving_880x500-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> <img class="aligncenter wp-image-462282" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/my20_corsa-edition_3qrr_red_driving_880x500.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="668" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/my20_corsa-edition_3qrr_red_driving_880x500.jpg 749w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/my20_corsa-edition_3qrr_red_driving_880x500-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> Compared to the outgoing model, the new Corsa lost up to 10% of weight, translating into a curb weight of 980 kilograms for this five-door model in its lightest form.
