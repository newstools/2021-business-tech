South Africa’s car market in 2020 was severely hampered by economic recession, and a year that saw the Covid-19 pandemic thwart the envisaged momentum from a 300-basis point interest rate cut during the year. Sales data from the National Association of Automobile Manufacturers of South Africa (Naamsa) showed a substantial decline in new vehicle sales of 156,163 units, or -29.1%, from 536,612 units in 2019 to 380,449 units in 2020. “Vehicle sales are linked to the strength of the economy, and the pandemic not only deepened an existing economic recession, but its severe impact resulted in that the domestic new vehicle market in 2020 dropping back to the levels of two decades ago,” Naamsa said. South Africa entered a recession before the outbreak of Covid-19, which means middle-class disposable income was already under pressure prior to the national lockdown, it said. Toyota accumulated a 23.7% market share by year end, with the Hilux retaining its spot as the country’s best-selling vehicle. The Japaense brand sold 90,129 vehicles in 2020, down from 130,072 sales in 2019. Volkswagen SA, with a 21.6% market share, saw sales in 2020 decline 28.9% year on year. With 19,750 units sold in 2020, the locally manufactured Polo Vivo is SA’s best-selling passenger car. Ford’s overall sales volume was down from 50,827 to 35,272 units in 2019, with the EcoSport and Ford Ranger boosting its standing.
