The departure of the Covid-19 vaccines was attended by South Africa’s consul-general in Mumbai, Andrea Kühn, as well as consulate staff . At the event, Kühn extended her appreciation for the support from the government of India, SII, Mumbai International Airport Cargo, Expo Freight Private Limited and Emirates Airline for their assistance in the development and transportation of the vaccine. <img class="size-full wp-image-464404 aligncenter" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Vaccine-4.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="768" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Vaccine-4.jpg 1024w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Vaccine-4-300x225.jpg 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Vaccine-4-768x576.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> <img class="size-full wp-image-464406 aligncenter" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Vaccine-3.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="768" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Vaccine-3.jpg 1024w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Vaccine-3-300x225.jpg 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Vaccine-3-768x576.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> <img class="size-full wp-image-464408 aligncenter" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Vaccine-2.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="766" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Vaccine-2.jpg 1024w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Vaccine-2-300x224.jpg 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Vaccine-2-768x575.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> <img class="size-full wp-image-464410 aligncenter" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Vaccine-1-1.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="768" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Vaccine-1-1.jpg 1024w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Vaccine-1-1-300x225.jpg 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Vaccine-1-1-768x576.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> In a briefing on Wednesday evening (27 January), Health minister Dr Zweli Mkhize confirmed that one million dosages of the vaccine are scheduled to leave India on Sunday (31 January) and will arrive in the country on Monday (1 February). A further 500,000 vaccine doses are set to arrive in the country later in February. In a surprise announcement, Mkhize told the Sunday Times that South Africa is set to receive an additional 20 million doses of Covid-19 vaccine from pharmaceutical giant Pfizer. He said that these vaccines have been secured and that government was now just awaiting manufacturers to submit final agreements with details of delivery dates and exact amounts. Further vaccine orders would be announced once details had been finalised, Mkhize said. “We are negotiating, largely with Pfizer, AstraZeneca, Johnson & Johnson, but some of it is coming via the African Vaccine Acquisition Task Team and Covax. “We are reasonably comfortable that what we have paid for, signed for and are negotiating for will cover the numbers that we are looking to vaccinate,” he said. Mkhize also confirmed that the country has enough storage space to safely secure the vaccines at the correct temperatures, and that government plans to issue a formal tender process next week.
