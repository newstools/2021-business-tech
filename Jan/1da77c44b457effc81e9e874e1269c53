National Treasury and the South African Revenue Service (SARS) have published the annual Tax Statistics for 2020. The 2020 edition provides an overview of tax revenue collections and tax return information for the 2016 to 2019 tax years, as well as the 2015/16 to 2019/2020 fiscal years. “The 2019 technical recession led to slow growth in revenue collections, which culminated in a downward revision of revenue estimates,”  SARS said. “Whilst revenues generated from the tax system move in tandem with the economy, on average, the growth in tax revenues has been higher than economic growth.” Tax revenue collected amounted to R1 355.8 billion, growing year-on-year by R68.1 billion (5.3%), mainly supported by Personal Income Tax (PIT) which grew by R35.3 billion (7.2%).
