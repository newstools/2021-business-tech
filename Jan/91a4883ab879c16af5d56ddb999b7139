South Africa The index shows that South Africa has lost two places in the rankings, moving down to 54th position. At the start of 2021, SA passport holders are able to access 101 destinations without obtaining a prior visa. However, as with other countries, it faces ongoing travel restrictions due to the pandemic. At the end of December,  the UK’s Health and Social Care secretary Matt Hancock moved to ban travel between the two countries, citing the second Covid-19 variant as a key concern. This week Denmark said that it has also include  South Africa on its list of ‘banned countries’. “The entry ban for foreigners who do not reside in Denmark and travel from South Africa is in place from 6 January 2021 until and including 17 January 2021,” it said. As with South Africa’s opening of borders, countries that do allow travel for leisure and tourism purposes do not do so unconditionally, and will require travellers to either submit recent negative Covid-19 tests, or be subject to a mandatory quarantine period.
