BusinessTech has maintained its position as the biggest business news website in South Africa, based on the latest audited readership numbers. The December 2020 audience report from Narratiive – which is the official traffic measurement partner of the IAB South Africa – shows that BusinessTech received over 5.7 million South African browsers last month. The official figures were: South African Unique Browsers – 5,709,495
Pageviews – 18,001,437 What makes this large number more impressive is the fact that the majority of BusinessTech’s readers are professionals. They include CEOs, CTOs, CFOs, business owners, company directors, and managers. A breakdown of this high-level audience, based on the December 2020 readership report, is detailed below. Middle Management – 1,108,277
Junior Management – 882,337
Administration – 785,082
Business Owner – 609,217
Senior Management – 602,599
Self-Employed – 598,820
CEO/Director – 102,704 These professionals are key decision makers in their companies, many of whom are responsible for purchasing and strategic calls. It is interesting to note that this decision-making responsibility carries over into their personal lives, too. 85% of BusinessTech’s readers are either the primary or joint decision maker in their home. “By reaching South Africa’s decision makers, both where they work and where they live, BusinessTech has become one of the most influential publications in the country,” said BusinessTech MD Kevin Lancaster. “This is a major benefit to our advertising partners, who are able to reach their target audience while being associated with the well-established BusinessTech brand.” This article was published in partnership with BusinessTech.
