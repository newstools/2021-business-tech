Service delivery protests dipped to a nine-year low in 2020 largely because of the national lockdown due to the Covid-19 pandemic. This is according to the latest data by Municipal IQ, which specialises in local government data and collects information on service delivery protests. The lockdown regulations prohibited public gatherings and the police were on high alert. Violent service delivery protests fell from 78% to 75%.

Municipal IQ believes service delivery protests are tied to the level of policing under the Covid-19 regulations. “It has been seen in previous local government election years – should these continue later in the year – that service delivery protests fall, but there is no guarantee of this trend holding given the rising number of municipalities that find themselves financially and logistically stressed by the pandemic,” Heese said. “In many instances the pressure on municipalities in these provinces was a function of a demand for housing and free basic services with community members displaced or compromised by a loss of income,” Municipal IQ economist Karen Heese said.
