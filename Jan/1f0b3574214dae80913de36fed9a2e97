The City of Cape Town says that its Driving Licence Testing Centres (DLTCs) are working around the clock to assist members of the public with applications. While the national licence backlog cause by the hard lockdown in 2020 has largely been cleared, the city said that new backlogs are unfortunately created each time a DLTC has to close due to Covid-19 exposure of staff. “To increase capacity at the DLTCs, the City of Cape Town this week approved additional funding of R10.8 million on the adjustment budget, to assist with the extension of operational hours to deal with the increase in demand,” said the city’s mayoral committee member for Safety and Security, JP Smith. He added that the city was currently awaiting provincial approval to allow for online licence applications. ‘”The city is very much aware of requests for online applications, especially as residents steer away from crowded places and prefer to do online transactions as far as possible. “In this regard, the city is waiting on approval from the Western Cape Provincial Administration regarding online applications for learners and driving licence appointments,” said Smith. He added that there is no online system for the renewal of a driving licence card and that the driving licence renewal must still be done in person. “The Western Cape Provincial Government and National Government have indicated a rollout of a pilot project with the City as soon as the challenges with the implementation of a online system are ironed out,” he said.
