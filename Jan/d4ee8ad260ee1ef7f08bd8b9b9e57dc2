A number of countries have announced travel bans to and from South Africa, citing fears of the new Covid-19 variant discovered in the country. A variant of the SARS-COV-2 Virus (Covid-19) – currently termed the ‘501.V2 Variant’ –  was  identified by genomics scientists in South Africa and formally announced by government in late December. Health minister Dr Zweli Mkhize said a genomics team, led by the Kwazulu-Natal Research Innovation and Sequencing Platform, or KRISP, has sequenced hundreds of samples from across the country since the beginning of the pandemic in March. They noticed that a particular variant has increasingly dominated the findings of the samples collected in the past two months. In a national address on Monday evening (11 January), president Cyril Ramaphosa confirmed that South Africa’s second coronavirus wave was being driven by this new variant. However, he said that early scientifc evidence showed that while the variant is more virulent, it is not more dangerous than the initial strain.
