The Department of Health has provided more information on its electronic vaccination data system (EVDS) which will be used alongside the roll-out of Covid-19 vaccines across the country. The system aims to assist in both the management and surveillance of the Covid-19 vaccine. Among other features, the EVDS will provide and track vaccine information, such as: Patient information, including demographics and number of doses;
Safety information – such as possible adverse events following immunisation;
Details of vaccine administration sites. A key feature of the EVDS system is a self-enrollment portal which will allow users to register online for a Covid-19 vaccination. In the country’s first phase of the vaccine roll-out, this will primarily be healthcare workers and other at-risk groups. To receive a vaccination appointment, individuals will be required to register using the online portal. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-464234" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Portal-1.png" alt="" width="644" height="675" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Portal-1.png 466w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Portal-1-286x300.png 286w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> As part of this process, individuals will be required to submit general information, as well as information about their place of work. This will then be used to match them to a registered vaccination service point when the vaccine is allocated. The Department of Health said that information provided on the portal will also be used to communicate with individuals about the vaccination program when necessary. It added that all healthcare workers, public, private, clinical and nonclinical should register online on this platform. <img class="size-full wp-image-464236 aligncenter" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Portal-2.png" alt="" width="1246" height="507" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Portal-2.png 1246w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Portal-2-300x122.png 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Portal-2-1024x417.png 1024w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Portal-2-768x313.png 768w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Portal-2-1200x488.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> Step-by-step guide The Department of Health provided the following step-by-step guide on how the process will work: The healthcare worker (or other user) completes the registration period as above; Those who qualify will be sent a notification through SMS informing them of the time and place that the vaccine will be available. It will also come with a unique code that patients will be required to show to their vaccinator; Upon arrival at the site, patients will be required to provide their ID and a contact number, as well as any medical aid details; Upon providing this information, as well as the unique code, the vaccinator confirms that the person will be eligible to receive the vaccine; The vaccinator administers the vaccine, and then captures the required info on EVDS. This includes a unique record of the vaccination code; The patient will then receive an SMS indicating that they have received the first dose of the vaccine. It will also include a schedule for the second dose appointment. <img class="size-full wp-image-464254 aligncenter" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Step-by-step.png" alt="" width="1396" height="721" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Step-by-step.png 1396w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Step-by-step-300x155.png 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Step-by-step-1024x529.png 1024w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Step-by-step-768x397.png 768w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Step-by-step-1200x620.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> As part of this monitoring system, there are plans to send reminders for a follow-up appointment to receive a second dose and to include an integrated track-and-trace system for defaulters – those who do not show up to receive their second shot. The Department said that there will be extensive communication to inform healthcare workers of this process through different platforms and mechanisms including social media, professional organisations, and labour unions.
