Eskom has announced that stage 2 load shedding will be implemented from 12h00 on Thursday (14 January) until 23h00 on Sunday evening (17 January). The power utility said that the load shedding was necessary due to the loss of generation capacity overnight. Two generation units at the Kusile power station have tripped due to the failure of the main coal feed conveyor belts supplying coal to the units. “In addition, a unit each at the Kriel and Duvha stations tripped due to unforeseen breakdown,” Eskom said. “We presently have four generation nits whose return to service from planned maintenance has been delayed.” Eskom said it currently has 5,358 MW on planned maintenance and another 14,748 MW of capacity remains unavailable due to unplanned maintenance, breakdowns, and the outage delays mentioned above. The power utility said its teams are working around the clock to return as many of the affected units to service as soon as possible.
