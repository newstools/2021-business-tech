Qatar Airways has signed an interline agreement with domestic airline Mango, further expanding its presence in South Africa as the largest international carrier to operate from the region. The agreement with Mango will provide passengers with seamless connectivity via Johannesburg and Cape Town to one international destination in Tanzania and seven domestic destinations in South Africa. The additional list of destinations include: Durban International Airport,
Port Elizabeth International Airport,
George Airport,
Bram Fischer International Airport,
East London Airport
Abeid Amani Karume International Airport in Tanzania. Mango said that as part of the partnership the airlines will offer an interline e-ticketing agreement which will provide passengers with direct connection to destinations in South Africa and Zanzibar. Guests will be able to get to their destination via a connection, using two different airlines, by paying one fare with only one ticket being issued for both airlines. Qatar Airways currently operates 19 weekly flights to three key destinations in South Africa; Cape Town, Durban and Johannesburg. The airline now operates over 75 weekly flights to 23 African destinations operated by a mix of the airline’s modern fuel-efficient Airbus A350 and Boeing 787 aircraft. The national carrier of the State of Qatar said that it will continue to rebuild its global network, which currently stands at over 120 destinations with plans to increase to over 130 by the end of March 2021. Due to uncertainty caused by the pandemic, Qatar Airways said it will offer unlimited date changes and fee-free refunds for all tickets issued before 30 April 2021, for travel completed by 31 December 2021. The carrier’s flexible booking policy also provides the permanent feature of exchanging tickets for a travel voucher with 10% additional value for all customers booking travel through its website.
