The Toyota Hilux is South Africa’s most desired used car, new data from AutoTrader, shows, garnering the most search interest in the 2020 calendar year. The Hilux – the most searched for bakkie on AutoTrader in 2020, the most sold new bakkie in the country last year and the country’s most sold new car too – romped home in first place in the total used vehicle search statistics. It was also the most searched for used vehicle in 2019. George Mienie, AutoTrader chief executive, said: “This vehicle – built right here in South Africa – doesn’t just dominate new bakkie sales; it also dominates total new vehicle sales. “This is because the Hilux is perceived to be a well built and reliable vehicle that has the support of an impressive dealer network.” In 2020, the Volkswagen Golf demonstrated gains in popularity in the used car market, moving from the fourth most searched for used vehicle in 2019 to the second most searched for in 2020. This, Mienie said, could be as a result of the lockdown and impact on the economy as many motorists have tightened their belts. Accordingly, demand for the Golf has risen above that of two luxury German sedans, namely the Mercedes-Benz C-Class and BMW 3 Series. This could also be thanks to the popularity of individual Golf variants. According to AutoTrader’s latest annual Car Industry Report, which covers the period July 2019 to June 2020, when it comes to individual variant searches, Golf models account for two of the top four. The Volkswagen Golf GTI was the most searched for variant, followed by the Volkswagen Polo GTI, Mercedes-Benz C-Class C63 AMG and Volkswagen Golf R. Variant search, first introduced in May 2019, allows car shoppers to search for specific variants using text, as the technology builds a list. According to the same report, the Volkswagen Golf also saw the biggest shift in Consumer Advert Views (CAVs), moving from sixth to second place with 3.15% (5,6 million) of total CAVs. 1 Toyota Hilux <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-438841" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Hilux-2.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="667" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Hilux-2.jpg 1000w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Hilux-2-300x200.jpg 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Hilux-2-768x512.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> 2 Volkswagen Golf <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-393716" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Golf2.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="767" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Golf2.jpg 1000w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Golf2-300x230.jpg 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Golf2-768x589.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> 3 Mercedes-Benz C-Class <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-463946" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/C-class.jpg" alt="" width="1120" height="630" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/C-class.jpg 1120w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/C-class-300x169.jpg 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/C-class-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/C-class-768x432.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> 4 BMW 3 Series <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-288886" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/BMW3series3-e1543847405330.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="800" /> 5 Ford Ranger <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-444219" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/FordRanger-1-e1603895986341.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="801" /> 6 Volkswagen Polo <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-417033" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Volkswagen-polo-e1594890591418.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="801" /> 7 BMW 1 Series <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-434171" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/BMW-1-Series-e1600340004978.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="849" /> 8 Toyota Fortuner <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-447338" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Fortuner7-e1604994744129.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="675" /> 9 BMW X5 <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-251241" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/BMWX5-e1528813214404.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="750" /> 10 Audi A3 <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-342715" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/AudiA3.jpg" alt="" width="1160" height="677" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/AudiA3.jpg 1160w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/AudiA3-300x175.jpg 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/AudiA3-768x448.jpg 768w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/AudiA3-1024x598.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> Read: South Africa’s 10 best-selling bakkies in 2020 – with prices
