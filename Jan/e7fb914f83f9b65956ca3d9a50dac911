CareerJunction has published its latest monthly jobs index for December 2020, showing which job skills are currently the most sought-after in South Africa. The CareerJunction Index (CJI) represents online labour dynamics in the country by providing a detailed analysis of the relative ratio of supply and demand in the online job market. The data shows that during December, hiring activity and job search activity experienced an expected drop due to the holiday season. The marketing, manufacturing & assembly, sales and architecture & engineering sectors have shown increased recruitment activity over the past few months. The CJI settled at 99 index points indicating stable conditions in the job search market. An index score below 100 indicates that there are fewer job opportunities for potential job seekers and more potential job seekers per job advert. Recruitment is easier due to more potential job seekers per job advert in this market. A score above 100, meanwhile, implies the opposite – that there are more job opportunities for potential job seekers, and fewer potential job seekers per job advert.
