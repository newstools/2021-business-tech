Social Development minister Lindiwe Zulu has published new data showing the number of South Africans rely on grants given by the government. Responding in a recent parliamentary Q&A, Zulu provided data on the numbers of grant recipients per year as at 31 March of each year from 1996/97. Zulu’s data further expressed this number as a percentage of the population based on estimates. The minister said that data from 1994 is not available, as this had not yet been consolidated into a single database, but was managed provincially. The increasing reliance on grants can be partially attributed to the change of power in 1994 and the fact that many South Africans would not necessarily have been given access to grants under the apartheid government. However, the opposition Democratic Alliance has been critical of the figures, noting that nearly a third of South Africans now rely on grants according to the data. “For many households grant payments have replaced salaries as their source of income. While the DA supports the payment of grants, the creation of jobs is of the utmost importance. South Africans need jobs, not just for financial stability but also for the dignity it provides, and the government has utterly failed to stimulate job growth,” it said. While a natural inclination would be to blame the Covid-19 pandemic, the DA said that the first sharp increase to 20% of the population receiving grants happened in the 2004/05 financial year and has been steadily rising ever since, with 30% of South Africans having to rely on grants since 2010/11. “The data clearly indicates that the ANC government and its policies have had an active hand in impoverishing South Africans long before global economic implosions, State Capture or the Covid-19 pandemic made their marks in the history books,” it said.
