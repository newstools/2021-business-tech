In this episode of Business Talk with Michael Avery, Lichtenstein talks about the technical challenges companies have faced with employees working from home during the Covid-19 pandemic. The upshot, he said, is that this has led many to better understand the tech they are using, and once customers understand the power of technology, ‘they want more’ – faster. Lichtenstein said that the pandemic has forced companies to reassess how they operate daily, to find efficiency. He said that some changes can be small, but can make all the difference around productivity. Lichtenstein also talks through some of the trends in the tech space right now, and in-demand by small business. The full interview is embedded below.
