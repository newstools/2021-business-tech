Isaac Matshego is an economist at financial services firm, Nedbank, specialising in macroeconomic and market analysis of emerging markets – mainly Sub-Saharan African economies. Matshego has a particular focus in country risk and sovereign debt analysis as well as exchange rate analysis and forecasting. He has picked up a number of economics related degrees from North-West University, and more recently from The University of Cape Town Graduate School of Business. In this episode of Business Talk with Michael Avery, Matshego puts South Africa in context when it comes to global markets, and talks through the importance of remaining attractive to international investors – especially in relation to funding a rising budget deficit. Matshego alludes to some of the key challenges facing finance minister Tito Mboweni, when he delivers his Medium-Term Budget policy statement (MTBPS) next month, while also forecasting the country’s economic growth projections in the short-term. Cutting expenditure, he says, should be at the top government’s agenda, along with a solution to Eskom’s electricity generation and debt problems, which remains a drag on domestic growth.
