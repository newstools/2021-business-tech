Disruptive technologies, easy and immediate access to vast sources of information, and virtual interactive platforms mean that borders are becoming less important for young South African workers. This is one of the key findings in PwC’s new Workforce Preference Study which received 3,894 responses from individuals in South Africa. The report provides an overview of what young people are looking for from (future) employers in South Africa, with most of the respondents either working full-time or still in higher education. “Borders lost their relevance as free or easy movement in the world is a hygiene factor that is expected by younger people. “International mobility programmes allow them to travel smoothly and virtually as technologies allow them to keep connected wherever they are. As a result, South African youth are interested in international opportunities, PwC said. The data shows that the preference for opportunities to spend time working abroad is also higher for those aged 30 and younger. <img class="size-full wp-image-475474 aligncenter" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Home-country.png" alt="" width="530" height="601" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Home-country.png 530w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Home-country-265x300.png 265w" sizes="(max-width: 530px) 85vw, 530px" /> When asked about the preferred industries that they would like work in, the financial services industry elicited the highest level of interest from respondents. “However, this may be attributable to the fact that a number of respondents are already working in this industry,” PwC said. “A number of participants also showed interest in: IT;
Technology;
Digital;
Retail;
Media;
Telecommunications; and
Tourism. While PwC’s survey focuses on the 18-30 age group, Rand Merchant Bank chief executive James Formby has warned that the country’s post-lockdown economy is likely to be set back by a brain drain of skills leaving the country. In a February interview, Formby said that the country is losing qualified and experienced people in their thirties and forties to positions overseas. This is especially the case for skills in the infrastructure and development sectors, which have been highlighted by president Cyril Ramaphosa as key to the country’s recovery. Formby added that it was extremely difficult to bring skilled people into the country which has led to an erosion in the country’s skill base – a serious issue flagged by RMB.
