Eskom has announced that load shedding will be extended to the weekend, at a reduced stage. The group said that load shedding will be cut to stage 1 from Wednesday 05h00, and will run until 05h00 on Saturday. Stage 2 load shedding was implemented on Wednesday 10 March 2021. Eskom said that while it has returned four generation units at the Kusile, Grootvlei, Kriel and Matla power stations, the grid remains severely constrained. “The (return) has not been sufficient to suspend load shedding at this point,” it said, adding that further generation capacity has been lost at the Medupi, Arnot and Komati power stations. “Additionally, the return to service of four other units has been delayed, prolonging the need to continue implementing load shedding. Eskom is working hard to return the units back to service as soon as possible.” Eskom on Monday warned that load shedding is likely to be a feature in South Africa until grid stability improves, which will only happen closer to September 2021 after planned maintenance programmes are completed. The power utility warned that, without additional capacity added to the grid, there is likely to be a 4,000MW to 6,000MW shortfall over the next five years, as power stations reach their end of life.
