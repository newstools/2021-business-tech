Eskom will suspend load shedding between 10h00 and 14h00 in order to allow the nation to mourn the passing of His Majesty King Goodwill Zwelithini. The power utility said that in order to allow the nation to participate in the memorial service of King Goodwill Zwelithini kaBhekuzulu, it has decided to suspend the implementation of load shedding for a brief period, breaking away from the stage 2 shedding it announced on Wednesday “This extraordinary measure has been implemented to allow the nation to witness a key and significant historical event at this difficult time in the life of the Zulu nation. Afterwards, load shedding will then be implemented and continue as previously communicated,” it said in a statement. “The power system remains constrained and vulnerable, and as such, Eskom requests the public to continue reducing the usage of electricity in order to minimise the pressure on the system.” The power utility said that it will communicate timeously should there be any significant changes to the power system.
