Toyota has unveiled its new Urban Cruiser crossover in South Africa, taking an aim at the budget crossover market. It is the second product of the Toyota-Suzuki alliance, following the launch of the Starlet. The Urban Cruiser is powered by a 1.5-litre naturally-aspirated four-cylinder engine, delivering 77 kW of power and 138 Nm of torque. Buyers have the option of a 5-speed manual transmission or 4-speed automatic, reaching a top speed of 170 km/h. Fuel consumption is registered at a frugal 6.2 litres per 100km, while CO2 emissions fall within the 145 to 147 g/km range. The safety and security specifications include ABS and EBD, side protection beams, driver and passenger airbags and ISOFIX. An alarm and immobiliser system is also included on all models. <img class="size-full wp-image-473864 aligncenter" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/UrbanCruiser.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="667" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/UrbanCruiser.jpg 1000w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/UrbanCruiser-300x200.jpg 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/UrbanCruiser-768x512.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> <img class="size-full wp-image-473866 aligncenter" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/UrbanCruiser1.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="667" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/UrbanCruiser1.jpg 1000w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/UrbanCruiser1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/UrbanCruiser1-768x512.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-473880" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/UrbanCruiser10.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="667" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/UrbanCruiser10.jpg 1000w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/UrbanCruiser10-300x200.jpg 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/UrbanCruiser10-768x512.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> Different grades Toyota said that a three-grade strategy has been adopted, using the now-familiar Toyota grade names Xi, Xs and Xr. The entry-level Xi model features a keyless-entry with push start, electric windows, air-conditioning, tilt-adjustable steering, power-adjustable mirrors, LED headlamps and LED Daytime Running Lights (DRL). Rear Park Distance Control (PDC) offers drivers additional peace of mind. The mid-tier Xs model adds alloy wheels, roof rails, body-coloured door handles, power-retractable mirrors and a rear window wiper with demister function. On the inside, the Xs offers auto air-conditioning (climate control) and reverse camera, and a secondary glove compartment. The flagship, the Xr features LED fog lamps, automatic headlights, cruise control, an auto-dimming rear-view mirror, rain-sensing wipers, dual 12-volt power outlets, a front armrest, a leather steering wheel and the inclusion of two tweeter speakers. <img class="size-full wp-image-473872 aligncenter" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/UrbanCruiser5.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="667" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/UrbanCruiser5.jpg 1000w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/UrbanCruiser5-300x200.jpg 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/UrbanCruiser5-768x512.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-473898" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/UrbanCruiser11.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="667" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/UrbanCruiser11.jpg 1000w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/UrbanCruiser11-300x200.jpg 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/UrbanCruiser11-768x512.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-473868" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/UrbanCruiser3.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="667" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/UrbanCruiser3.jpg 1000w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/UrbanCruiser3-300x200.jpg 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/UrbanCruiser3-768x512.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> Pricing The pricing for the various grades is as follows: Urban Cruiser 1.5 Xi MT – R247 900
