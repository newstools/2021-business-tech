Adapt IT on Tuesday (9 March) reported a 2% drop in revenue for the six months ended December 2020, to R707 million, due to ongoing challenging and weaker trading conditions particularly in South Africa – which remains the group’s primary market, constituting 73% of total revenue. Profit from operations, however, improved by a percent, to R79.83 million. “The Covid-19 global pandemic caused repeated shutdowns or slowdowns in certain of our client segments resulting in project volume decline and delays, with project based revenue suffering longer lead times,” it said. Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) was R128 million, marginally down from R129 million in 2019. The impacts on earnings in the current period included an increase in bonus provision of R16 million, a negative foreign exchange movement of R10 million, and an increase in the allowance for expected credit losses of R7 million resulting from client segments most impacted by Covid-19, it said. Headline earnings per share (HEPS) increased by 44% to 20.69 cents from 14.40 cents and normalised HEPS increased by 16% to 32 cents from 27.70 cents. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-474192" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ADaptIT1.png" alt="" width="813" height="385" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ADaptIT1.png 813w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ADaptIT1-300x142.png 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ADaptIT1-768x364.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> Adapt IT provides specialised software and digitally-led business solutions  predominantly in the education, manufacturing, financial services, energy, communications and hospitality industries.
