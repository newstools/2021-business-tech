Daily deals website OneDayOnly listed an exclusive luxury micro-apartment in Cape Town for R800,000 – and it sold just hours after going live. The apartment is part of The Tokyo – a 148 unit residential development by Rawson Developers in the Cape Town City Centre, and has a ‘regular’ asking price R950,000. “Located on the corner of Longmarket and Loop Street, the development seamlessly combines old and new to produce an upmarket product for property investors, frequent visitors, and residents alike. “Within walking distance lie countless bars, restaurants, and a myriad of boutique retail destinations. It further boasts central access to hotspots like the CBD, Cape Town International Convention Centre, V&A Waterfront, and Table Mountain,” Rawson said. The anticipated completion date of the unit is May 2023, based on construction commencing on 1 September 2021. This is subject to change, the developers note. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-476120" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Micro-3.jpg" alt="" width="900" height="755" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Micro-3.jpg 610w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Micro-3-300x252.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> <img class=" wp-image-476122 aligncenter" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Micro-2.jpg" alt="" width="906" height="604" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Micro-2.jpg 1200w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Micro-2-300x200.jpg 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Micro-2-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Micro-2-768x512.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> The Tokyo apartments are sold without parking. “This is because a high percentage of tenants these days living in our developments do not require parking and as such we have excluded parking from the building and the price,” it noted. “The building is centrally situated so many occupants will use Uber and similar services to be able to get to wherever they need to go at affordable rates. “We have however provided a number of solutions for interested buyers and future tenants including the neighbouring building that has bays for sale and to rent.” Some of the key features of the micro-apartments include: 148 apartments over 15 floors;
