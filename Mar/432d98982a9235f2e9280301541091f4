JD Group has launched online shopping platform Everyshop in South Africa, offering a range of global brands in a curated assortment of tech, electronics, appliances, fashion, beauty and many other categories. A division of Pepkor Holdings, JD Group already owns high-profile retail chains including Incredible Connection and HiFi Corp. “With the support of our existing retail businesses we have partnered with some of South Africa’s most well-known and loved brands across a number of industries including specialist electronics & appliances, furniture, fashion, footwear and DIY to deliver true value to the South African shopper through the launch of a new online retailer,” Everyshop said. Everyshop is supported by a national network of 16 distribution centres that deliver to the home using a dedicated logistics fleet, and courier partners. As many of these products are big-ticket items, JD Group’s stores also offer credit finance solutions. The increased need for convenience through online shopping has inspired the company to look at new ways to serve its customers, it said. Everyshop features existing product ranges within the group’s network of stores, and includes new product categories and products. It offers products in 10 main categories – entertainment, fashion, health & beauty, perfect home, work & study, projects & DIY, lifestyle & leisure, fitness, cellular, and kid’s world.
