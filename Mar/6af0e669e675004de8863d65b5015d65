Toyota has bolstered its Corolla Quest product offering in 2021, which includes keyless entry and push-button start across the range. While retaining the familiar 1.8-litre, single-engine line-up, the previously un-badged entry grade has been renamed Plus, while the Prestige and Exclusive grades are carried over, it said. The Plus specifications focus on delivering a value-minded product offering. Daytime Running Lights (DRL), colour-coded power-adjustable mirrors, air-conditioner, electric windows, steering switches and audio system with Bluetooth and USB functionality, are joined by matte black treatment for the radiator grille and 15” steel wheels. The Prestige models receive an upgrade to a touchscreen DVD audio system with six speakers, reverse camera, cruise control, leather steering wheel, combination fabric and leather seats plus the 16-inch alloy wheels. The Exclusive grade adds auto air-conditioner, TFT-colour instrument cluster, leather seats, rain-sensing wipers and LED headlamps. New for 2021 is the addition of Smart Entry, which was previously only offered on the Exclusive flagship. The other specifications on the Prestige and Exclusive models remain unchanged. Toyota Connect is also fitted as standard across the range. The colour palette has also been expanded with the inclusion of the stylish Oxide Bronze – increasing the paint colour options to six. As before the 103 kW 1.8-litre engine propels all Quest variants, with Torque checking in at 173 Nm. Buyers can choose from either a 6-speed manual or ‘7-step’ CVT transmission.
