BusinessTech’s latest audience figures reveal that it continues to be the largest and most influential business publication in South Africa. Its position as the leading business news website in the country is thanks to the large number of crucial business decision makers who read the site every month. 1.5 million of BusinessTech’s monthly readers are CEOs, Directors, Business Owners, and Senior Managers. This high-end group of people is responsible for shaping their companies’ purchasing decisions. With more companies shifting their operations online permanently, and more people working through digital channels, online news sites such as BusinessTech have seen a big growth in their audiences. More South Africans now start their day by reading news online, and this is the perfect time and place for companies to reach their target market. Digital advertising channels – including sponsored articles, display banners, video interviews, dedicated mailers, and social media promotions – allow companies to speak directly to potential clients when they are the most engaged. The combination of more people spending more time online, and companies being able to target audiences when they are the most engaged, has resulted in a big increase in the number of advertising campaigns moving online. Online advertising also provides the best return on investment, making it an easy decision for companies to allocate marketing spend.
