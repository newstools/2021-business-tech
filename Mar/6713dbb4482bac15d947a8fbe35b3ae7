The National Treasury RT15 bid evaluation committee has appointed MTN SA as a service provider to government, through its new mobile communication services contract known as RT15-2021. The RT15 2021 Transversal contract allows for all entities of state to utilise the contract for mobile communication services, which will further assist with cost containment, MTN said. The scale of the government’s requirements has enabled MTN to develop innovative pricing and products and systems that it said, will significantly improve on existing mobile telecommunications service delivery, while also allowing for a high degree of control of spend by the individual entities. Godfrey Motsa, chief executive office of MTN South Africa, said he and his executive team are proud to accept the call to serve the country, through the provision of these vital services. “We are both humbled and honoured by the faith National Treasury has shown in MTN with this critical partnership over a five-year term. A huge team at MTN spent months analysing the state’s requirements and then developing the very best solutions to not only meet those expectations, but to exceed them,” Motsa said. MTN said that with the allocation of the temporary spectrum by the telecommunications regulator, it has been able to zero-rate over a thousand health and education websites, expand its reach into underserved communities and further boost its quality in high density areas. “The allocation of permanent spectrum will see government services and officials, through the RT15 contract, being important beneficiaries of the spectrum’s immediate value through further enhancements to MTN’s superior network, expanded reach into currently underserved communities and further quality gains in all parts of the country – which is why we are anxious to support any moves to mediate a solution to the current spectrum delays,” Motsa said. “In addition to mobile devices, accessories and value-added services, there are vital operations that must be maintained, such as air operations, the needs of the special task force, sea, rail, satellite and other critical functions,” said Wanda Matandela, chief enterprise officer at MTN SA.
