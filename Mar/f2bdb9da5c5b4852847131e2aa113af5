Statistics South Africa has published its National Household Travel Survey (NHTS), detailing how much time South African workers spend in traffic and how much transport costs each month. The report shows that more than one-third (34.2%) of the country’s 16.6 million workers reside in Gauteng, 15.6% reside in KwaZulu-Natal and 14.4% in the Western Cape. The majority of the working population works five days per week. Nationally, 62% workers worked five days a week, followed by 24.1% who worked six days plus and 13.8% worked one to four days a week.
