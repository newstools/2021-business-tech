The South African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC) says it has has concluded its section 189 retrenchment process, which will see 621 people leaving the group at the end of March. Of this amount, 346 employees opted for voluntary severance packages, while 275 employees occupied positions which have been made redundant. “Some were concerned about the impact of lower job scale codes resulting from the organisation-wide job evaluation process, on current salaries and their pension. These colleagues took voluntary severance packages as a first option and chose not to participate in any alternative job-seeking processes,” the SABC said. “Some employees in (the redundant) category went through the recruitment process seeking alternative opportunities but were, unfortunately, not successful. The SABC used its best endeavours and managed to absorb affected employees who qualified for vacant positions during the recruitment process.” SABC group chief executive officer, Madoda Mxakwe, said that the retrenchment process was “extremely difficult for all stakeholders” and became emotionally charged at times. “The extended process unfortunately also created prolonged uncertainty and a sense of despondency for many. This was understandable and regrettable. “However, despite these challenges, the section 189 process was a necessary component of the SABC’s turnaround plan to ensure the public broadcaster’s long term financial sustainability and capacity to fulfil its extensive public mandate,” he said. The broadcaster said it will transition into a new ‘fit-for-purpose structure’, effective 1 April 2021.
