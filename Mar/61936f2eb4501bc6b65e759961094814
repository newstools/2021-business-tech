New developments usually don’t require a deposit, but this means that your monthly repayments will increase to compensate. If you are willing to pay a deposit, this will reduce your monthly repayments as well as the interest you will need to pay over the course of your bond. It is important that you consider how much money that can be set aside to repay your bond each month. This means you need to take into account your monthly expenses and then determine what you will have left over to put into your bond. As a guideline, your bond affordability amount should be approximately a third of your salary, but this is not a hard and fast rule. Your marital status will be considered by the bank when it reviews your bond application. If you are married in Community of Property the bank will consider both of your financial statuses to determine what size bond you qualify for, whereas if you are not, you are then eligible to apply on your own merits and the contract will be between you and the bank exclusively. You can apply with a friend, relative, or anyone else, and your financial statuses will all be considered together. The most common bond repayment period is 20 years – however, this can vary from 10 years in some cases to even 30 years in others. The longer the loan term, the lower the monthly instalments – but the more interest you will pay over the period. Listen to this podcast to learn more.
