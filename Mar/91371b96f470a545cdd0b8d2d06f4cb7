Data from AutoTrader shows that the average mileage of second-hand cars sold on its platform in the six months ending December 2020 was 70,429km, and for an average price of R312,794. As consumers will search and shop for cars in a way that suits their preference and needs, AutoTrader analysed how car shoppers search for body types in its 2020 AutoTrader Bi-Annual Car Industry Report. For auto manufacturers and dealers, this provides an understanding of which body types of various models capture the most consumer attention and sell the most cars. “We have seen a 65% increase in body type searches year-on-year indicating that there is more of a consumer need to search by body type,” it said. Consumer buying behaviour in this area has also been influenced by more brands having released various shapes of the “same” model. For example: Mercedes-Benz A-Class & Audi A3 are both available as a hatchback or sedan. Ford Ranger & Toyota Hilux come in both single, extended and double-cabs, it said. AutoTrader said that its methodology took into account when a car shopper entered a single body type. “Interestingly, when considering SUV-only body type searches, car shoppers were less concerned about specific models but rather focused on preferred brands, with the top searched SUV brands by body type being Toyota, BMW and Volkswagen respectively.” Over 46 million searches were conducted by body type in six months, AutoTrader said. Single and double cab bakkies continued to generate the most search volume of all body type searches. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-477054" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/AutoTrader-1.png" alt="" width="976" height="748" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/AutoTrader-1.png 976w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/AutoTrader-1-300x230.png 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/AutoTrader-1-768x589.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> By ranking the body types by average price and mileage, dealers can determine whether stock held for these averages, the vehicle sales platform said. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-477052" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/AutoTrader1-1.png" alt="" width="972" height="789" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/AutoTrader1-1.png 972w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/AutoTrader1-1-300x244.png 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/AutoTrader1-1-768x623.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> AutoTrader noted that the intersection between price, mileage and body type give indications that the hatchback continues to offer the best value for money given that on average, it has the lowest mileage and latest year model for its price point. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-477048" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/AutoTrader2-1.png" alt="" width="972" height="653" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/AutoTrader2-1.png 972w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/AutoTrader2-1-300x202.png 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/AutoTrader2-1-768x516.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> Read: The most searched-for used car brands, and the most desired models in South Africa
