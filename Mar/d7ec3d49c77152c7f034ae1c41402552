Using data compiled after 276 million searches were conducted in the six months ending December 2020, AutoTrader reveals that the average mileage of second-hand cars sold on its platform was 70,429km, for an average model of 2016, at an average price of R312,794. For its 2020 AutoTrader Bi-Annual Car Industry Report, the vehicle market place also introduced Consumer Intent – the inquiries on vehicles – as a key indicator in the sales funnel for the first time. When coupling consideration (searches), leading indictators of demand as well as price data in an intelligent way, “dumb data” goes from being merely information to deep insights, revealing useful trends in consumer car shopping patterns, it said. AutoTrader  noted that the top three most inquired about brands were Toyota (14.2%), Volkswagen (12.5%) & BMW (10.7%). Together, these top three brands generated over 37% of all buying intent by consumers. When comparing consideration to intent (inquiries), the data showed some large differences between what consumers initially consider in their search versus what they actually inquire on in the end, AutoTrader said. As an example, Toyota moved from position four in search to first place in inquiries. Porsche moved from ninth in search to unlisted in inquiries. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-476748" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/AutoTrader2.png" alt="" width="1125" height="635" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/AutoTrader2.png 1125w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/AutoTrader2-300x169.png 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/AutoTrader2-1024x578.png 1024w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/AutoTrader2-768x433.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" />  <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-476740" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/AutoTrader1.png" alt="" width="830" height="756" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/AutoTrader1.png 830w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/AutoTrader1-300x273.png 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/AutoTrader1-768x700.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" />  The top 10 most inquired about models contributed 28% of all inquiries on AutoTrader.
