Growthpoint Properties says it has commenced the development of the first NTT data centre in Africa at the Centralpoint Innovation District in Johannesburg. Johannesburg 1 Data Centre – dubbed JOH1 – is being developed by Growthpoint on behalf of NTT Ltd and Dimension Data – which represents NTT’s business in the Middle East and Africa. NTT operates one of the largest data centre platforms in the world, with over 160 data centres spanning more than 20 countries and regions. The multi-million-rand, 12-month development project broke ground in September 2020. It will comprise 6,000 square metres of IT space and 20MW of IT load facility. JOH1 will also feature high-end offices with an NTT Technology Experience Lab (TEL), all supported by specialised state-of-the-art security solutions. Growthpoint said that the JOH1 project is scheduled for practical completion in the fourth quarter of 2021 and NTT intends to launch it in 2022. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-479939 size-large" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Joh1-1024x528.jpg" alt="" width="840" height="433" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Joh1-1024x528.jpg 1024w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Joh1-300x155.jpg 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Joh1-768x396.jpg 768w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Joh1-1536x792.jpg 1536w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Joh1-2048x1056.jpg 2048w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Joh1-1200x619.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> Dimension Data said the new data centre will be a state-of-the-art, highly secure, energy-efficient data centre offering maximum protection for its clients’ critical and sensitive IT systems. “Africa’s digital transformation will be accelerated with the right infrastructure investments,” said Dimension Data CEO Grant Bodley in September. “This partnership, bolstering our already significant data centre footprint, comes at a time when demand for digital content, cloud services, new technologies such as Internet of Things, mobile money and content delivery networks are on the rise.” JOH1 is Growthpoint’s fourth development in the 42-hectare Centralpoint Innovation District based in Samrand, Gauteng. Other developments include the 10,000 square metre Bakers SA Limited’s warehouse and distribution facility and regional offices, the 27,000 square metre Sterling Industrial Park comprising eight freestanding units built over two phases.
