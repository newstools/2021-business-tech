Volvo has announced that its XC40 Recharge Pure Electric – the first all-electric car from the Swedish luxury brand – will launch in South Africa in the second half of 2021. Greg Maruszewski, managing director at Volvo Car South Africa, said that the the XC40 Recharge Pure Electric is capable of travelling more than 400 km on a single charge. “It can be charged to 80% of its battery capacity in as little as 40 minutes using a fast charger,” he said. He added that the XC40 Recharge will deliver brisk performance, with its twin electric motors producing 304 kW (408 hp) of power and 660 Nm of torque to deliver a 0-100 km/h time of just 4.9 seconds. Volvo said that the lack of an internal combustion engine frees up space for an additional 30-litre storage compartment under the front bonnet, while the placement of the batteries under the centre of the car means space is not compromised elsewhere. Owners will be able to charge the vehicle at a dealership, at home or at one of the ever-growing network of public charging stations. Volvo said it is also rolling out an extensive network of charging stations at its dealerships and, by the end of 2021, each Volvo dealership will have a charging station. <img class="size-full wp-image-474282 aligncenter" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Volvo-2.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="513" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Volvo-2.jpg 1000w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Volvo-2-300x154.jpg 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Volvo-2-768x394.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> <img class="size-full wp-image-474284 aligncenter" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Volvo-1.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="591" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Volvo-1.jpg 1000w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Volvo-1-300x177.jpg 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Volvo-1-768x454.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> The XC40 is the first of five fully electric cars to be launched by the Swedish company over the next five years. “Volvo Cars will launch a fully electric car every year, as we look to make all-electric cars 50% of global sales by 2025, with the rest hybrids. “Recharge will be the overarching name for all chargeable Volvos with a fully electric and plug-in hybrid powertrain,” Maruszewski said. The launch of the XC40 Recharge is a significant step towards Volvo Cars’ ambition to reduce its CO2 footprint per car by 40% by 2025. “That same year, it expects 50% of its global sales to consist of fully electric cars, with the rest hybrids. But 2030, the company aims to only build electric cars,” he said. <img class="size-full wp-image-474286 aligncenter" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Volvo-4.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="697" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Volvo-4.jpg 1000w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Volvo-4-300x209.jpg 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Volvo-4-768x535.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> <img class="size-full wp-image-474288 aligncenter" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Volvo-3.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="685" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Volvo-3.jpg 1000w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Volvo-3-300x206.jpg 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Volvo-3-768x526.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> Maruszewski said that the XC40 Recharge will find favour in South Africa. “South Africans are already firm fans of the internal combustion engine-powered XC40; it had an 8.40% share of its segment in 2019; that grew to 14.70% in 2020.” Volvo said that dealers will start taking orders for the XC40 Recharge in April. Deliveries will commence in August and the price of the XC40 Recharge will be confirmed later this month. Read: Toyota launches Urban Cruiser for under R250,000 in South Africa
