Offshore consulting firm, Nomad Capitalist has published the 2021 Nomad Capitalist Index (NPI), pointing out the world’s best passports for entrepreneurs in 2021. The NPI ranks 199 citizenships on five factors, including visa-free travel, international taxation laws, global perception, dual citizenship, and personal freedom. The NPI’s travel score has been updated to reflect the economic impact of the Covid-19 pandemic. Luxembourg secures first place in the ranking, maintaining its place at the top of the list for the fourth year in a row. Tied for second are Ireland and Sweden, followed by Switzerland, Belgium, Finland, Portugal, Singapore, the Czech Republic, and the Netherlands. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-473414" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/NomadCapital-e1614934047765.png" alt="" width="1000" height="405" /> South Africa is well down the list, at 99th, scoring poorly for taxation, freedom, and perception. While most indexes – and most people – think of a passport only in terms of travel privileges, we realized that citizens of different countries deal with far different requirements to pay tax, live freely, comply with regulations, and avoid scrutiny when traveling, Nomad Capitalist said. In that regard, the number of countries a passport holder may visit does not tell the whole story. The Nomad Passport Index speaks to those seeking personal freedom and financial prosperity in a changing world by more deeply analyzing the true value of each passport, it said. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-473416" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/NomadCapital1.png" alt="" width="1383" height="338" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/NomadCapital1.png 1383w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/NomadCapital1-300x73.png 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/NomadCapital1-1024x250.png 1024w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/NomadCapital1-768x188.png 768w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/NomadCapital1-1200x293.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-473418" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/NomadCapital2.png" alt="" width="1389" height="276" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/NomadCapital2.png 1389w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/NomadCapital2-300x60.png 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/NomadCapital2-1024x203.png 1024w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/NomadCapital2-768x153.png 768w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/NomadCapital2-1200x238.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-473420" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/NomadCapital3.png" alt="" width="1372" height="279" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/NomadCapital3.png 1372w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/NomadCapital3-300x61.png 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/NomadCapital3-1024x208.png 1024w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/NomadCapital3-768x156.png 768w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/NomadCapital3-1200x244.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> You can access the full report here.
