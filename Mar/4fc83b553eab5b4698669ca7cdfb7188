Companies are increasingly looking to low-code to create great applications in a fraction of the time and at a fraction of the cost. Modern companies are painfully aware of how complex the coding environment can get. This is why they are increasingly looking at complementing their existing ecosystems with low-code, which can decrease many of the complexities that traditionally cost them time and money.

Gartner predicts that by 2024, low-code will contribute to over 65% of application development, and by 2023, 75% of large enterprises will be using a minimum of four low-code development tools for application development. The two biggest benefits of using low-code are that it saves you time and money. Low-code saves you considerable amounts of time by automating most of the coding process for your applications. This predominantly consists of the mundane code, any plumbing, project scaffolding, cross-cutting concerns, CI/DC pipeline and other tasks that do not require much business logic or creativity, but rather serve as the building blocks upon which your product team can now innovate quickly and with enterprise-grade confidence. Getting the DevSecOps setup and writing all the plumbing code for each application is often among the most time-consuming things to do, and low-code removes this wasted time by automatically generating vast amounts of core code upon which you can build your innovative solutions. Key cross-cutting elements that a good low-code platform automatically covers include security, scalability, and caching to name a few – ensuring you get these vital features and benefits without spending time on them. Low-code platforms like OutSystems, for example, enable organisations to deliver completed applications 3-7-times faster than would usually be the case using traditional methods. Another major benefit of low-code is the incredible amount of money that can be saved when compared to traditional alternatives. This is because it enables you to cut costs across a vast range of traditional development areas – including in development and testing, deployment, and maintenance. Low-code requires fewer technical people to look after the infrastructure as most low-code platforms provide a cloud-managed offering. Low-code requires fewer skilled resources in general which means a lower average wage and a quicker learning curve to onboard new employees. Additionally, it could potentially help consolidate or replaces expensive licences and tools that you may be paying for across several vendors – which can save you money. As an example, OutSystems has detailed how much time and money your business can save by switching to its low-code platform, below: <img class="aligncenter wp-image-475822" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Justsolve-infographic-300x213.png" alt="" width="640" height="453" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Justsolve-infographic-300x213.png 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Justsolve-infographic.png 720w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> There are multiple additional benefits that low-code platforms provide, including: Simplification – Low-code platforms offer a fully integrated CI/CD pipeline and a seamless DevOps environment.
Consistency – Low-code lets you work under a single set of architectures and standards.
Drag-and-drop – Low-code platforms offer drag-and-drop functionality, which makes it easier to build your applications visually and reuse modules across your applications.

Low-code offers major opportunities to South African organisations, as it is much easier and quicker to develop the skills of employees so they can use a low-code platform effectively. This in turn makes it possible for organisations to hire developers with less experience. In this interview on The Quintessential Show, JustSolve’s CEO, Botha van der Vyver, explained why South African companies should consider low-code.
