South Africans are significantly less willing to relocate to a new country than in 2018 according to a new study by the Boston Consulting Group (BCG) and CareerJunction. The study included almost 209,000 participants in 190 countries and 1,421 in South Africa, focusing on worker mobility and preferences. The findings show that the pandemic has had a major impact on people’s attitudes toward working abroad, reducing their interest generally and inclining them towards countries that have done the best job of containing the coronavirus. Only 59% of South Africans are willing to move to another country for work, which is down from a 72% willingness level in 2018. Young and highly educated South Africans aren’t willing to move abroad either – only 56% of young people and 61% of highly educated people in the country said they would be willing to relocate right now. <img class="size-full wp-image-472950 aligncenter" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Emigration-1.png" alt="" width="1280" height="720" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Emigration-1.png 1280w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Emigration-1-300x169.png 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Emigration-1-1024x576.png 1024w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Emigration-1-768x432.png 768w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Emigration-1-1200x675.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> <img class="size-full wp-image-472952 aligncenter" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Emigration-2.jpg" alt="" width="1280" height="720" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Emigration-2.jpg 1280w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Emigration-2-300x169.jpg 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Emigration-2-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Emigration-2-768x432.jpg 768w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Emigration-2-1200x675.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> “This is in line with the global trend of decreasing mobility – which is likely due to the pandemic, but also because of tighter immigration and less welcoming policies by some of the big destination markets,” said Rudi van Blerk, principal and recruiting director at Boston Consulting Group, Johannesburg. However, people in some of the most sought-after job roles are still extremely mobile and willing to move and work abroad; these include digitalisation and automation (85%), science & research (78%), law (76%) and IT (74%). “This could indicate a risk of brain drain in these fields, where employers typically struggle to fill roles,” said van Blerk. <img class="size-full wp-image-472954 aligncenter" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Emigration-3.png" alt="" width="1280" height="720" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Emigration-3.png 1280w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Emigration-3-300x169.png 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Emigration-3-1024x576.png 1024w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Emigration-3-768x432.png 768w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Emigration-3-1200x675.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> The United States remains the number one destination where people from South Africa would move to, but the next most popular destinations have shifted slightly. The United Kingdom overtook Australia, and New Zealand and the United Arab Emirates are also more popular targets than 2018, moving up a spot to fifth and sixth respectively. “This is also in line with global trends, with Asian and Middle East destinations growing in popularity, likely due to their comparably better management of Covid,” van Blerk said. Overall attractiveness of South Africa to global workers dropped slightly in 2020, but the country remains an attractive destination for other African countries such as Zambia, Angola and Gabon, as well as the Netherlands and United Kingdom internationally. <img class="size-full wp-image-472956 aligncenter" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Emigration-4.png" alt="" width="1280" height="720" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Emigration-4.png 1280w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Emigration-4-300x169.png 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Emigration-4-1024x576.png 1024w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Emigration-4-768x432.png 768w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Emigration-4-1200x675.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> Foreign companies While there is less willingness now to pull up stakes and move to a foreign country, the survey shows a high level of enthusiasm for virtual mobility – staying in one’s home country while working for a foreign employer. “Workers in the whole of Africa have shown that they are very open to working remotely for a foreign employer,” said Wiebka Cooper, operations manager at CareerJunction. “Remote working has grown significantly as a trend because of the pandemic and offers opportunities for workers to advance their careers even with international companies without needing to relocate.” <img class="size-full wp-image-472958 aligncenter" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Emigration-5.jpg" alt="" width="1280" height="720" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Emigration-5.jpg 1280w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Emigration-5-300x169.jpg 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Emigration-5-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Emigration-5-768x432.jpg 768w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Emigration-5-1200x675.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> South Africans have also shown their interest in virtual mobility, with 73% saying they are open to work for an international remote employer, compared to the global average of 57%. The US, UK and Australia are the top destinations where South Africans would look for remote employers – the same as the top target destinations for physical relocation. “This may have interesting implications: Africa could emerge as a possible virtual talent pool for Western companies – especially for European employers, who don’t need to deal with much time difference when employing African talent remotely,” said van Blerk. “This could be a good opportunity for South African workers to gain global work experience, build their career, and get better compensation – without having to worry about visas or relocation costs. However, this could present the risk of virtual brain drain for the South African economy.” Read: 1.6 million people are paying most of South Africa’s income tax
