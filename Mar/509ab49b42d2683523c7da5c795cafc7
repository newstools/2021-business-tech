Eskom has announced that its stage 2 load shedding will continue next week due to further breakdowns at five more power stations. The embattled utility said that the power cuts are now set to continue until 05h00 on Wednesday (17 March). “Eskom regrets to inform the public that the implementation of stage 2 load-shedding will continue until 05:00 on Wednesday as the generation capacity is still severely constrained,” Eskom said. “Over the past two days, Eskom teams successfully returned a generation each at the Matimba and Medupi power stations,” the power utility said. “However, during the weekend we have suffered further breakdowns at five power station, putting further strain on the generation capacity.” Eskom said that additional breakdowns occurred at the Tutuka, Majuba, Kusile, Matimba, and Duvha power stations, which added to the constraints caused by previous breakdowns at the Kriel and Kendal power stations. The power utility also said that there have been delays in restoring units to service at the Hendrina and Duvha power stations.
