No stranger to Cape Town’s Southern Suburbs, Rawson Developers are set to break ground on their first inner-city development. Highly acclaimed Rawson Developers are well-known for their innovation in the property arena and have captained a comprehensive collection of residential developments. The Tokyo however, will be their first City Centre endeavour throughout their 25 years of operation. Click here to learn more about The Tokyo. Their previous track record boasts renowned suburban developments such as Newlands Peak, The Winchester, The Westwood and The Premier. Last year, Newlands Peak famously sold over 100 apartments on the first day, despite unfavourable market conditions resulting from hard lockdown. The Tokyo, located in Loop Street, Cape Town CBD, is a 148-unit residential development which offers hotel-style living apartments in the heart of Cape Town City Centre. Influenced by Japan’s futuristic Capital, The Tokyo is the perfect blend of luxury and efficient city living. Consider it a zen refuge within the thriving cosmopolitan Mother City. Rawson Developers have expertly approached the art of functional design with this development. It is the ideal lock-up-and-go environment for urbanites, hustling professionals, and bachelors who still appreciate comfort and aesthetics alongside ease of living. This 15-storey development towers tall above its neighbours, offering cinematic views of Table Mountain rising from the sparkling city below. Ceiling to floor windows ensure residents get to enjoy every detail of glowing sunrises and moody sunsets, while framing one of Cape Town’s most iconic scenes – a piece of living art. It provides more than just a smart-space development with world-class views. The real focus is prioritising detailing over decoration and demonstrating just how simply a single space can be optimised for a multifunctional lifestyle – without compromising luxury. The Tokyo has huge investment potential. With apartments ranging from 26 to 51sqm luxury studio-apartments in an unrivalled location, this development is an obvious choice for both experienced and first-time property investors. When asked about their goals for The Tokyo, Brad Morgan, New Development Manager at Rawson Developers, was confident about the team’s big-picture ambitions. “Our overarching aim is to not only create buildings that enhance an area and boost its potential, but ones that also provide buyers with sound investment opportunities.” “Loop Street will be our first City Centre development, and we are keenly enthusiastic about the opportunity to offer an extra promise of investment and interest to the area.” “Increased foot traffic in the area will hopefully in turn also provide more clientele for local dining and retail establishments that have all felt the undeniable aftermath of a quiet lockdown period.” Sales launch online on March 16, 2021
