California Institute of Technology – Caltech dropped out of the top five for the first time since 2015, while ETH Zurich remains continental Europe’s best university for a fourteenth consecutive year.

Asia’s two top universities are National University of Singapore (11th) and Nanyang Technological University (12th). Latin America’s best university is Universidad de Buenos Aires (69th), which QS Quacquarelli Symonds said is hampered by low research impact scores. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-497091" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/QSUniversity.png" alt="" width="535" height="683" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/QSUniversity.png 535w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/QSUniversity-235x300.png 235w" sizes="(max-width: 535px) 85vw, 535px" /> South Africa For South Africa, nine universities are ranked, led once again by the University of Cape Town with an overall score of 40.3.
