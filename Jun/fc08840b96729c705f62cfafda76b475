Eskom has announced that stage 2 load shedding will be implemented from 16h00 on Tuesday (1 June) afternoon until 05h00 on Wednesday morning. The power utility said that there was a high possibility of load shedding continuing throughout the week due to breakdowns. In the last 24 hours breakdowns have occurred at generating units at Kriel, Arnot, Majuba and Tutka power stations, it said. There have also been delays in returning units online at Duvha and Tutuka, it said. “The load shedding will also assist to replenish the emergency generation reserves, which have been utilised extensively over the past weeks to avoid load shedding during the day,” it said.
