Eskom has announced that stage 2 load shedding will be implemented between 17h00 and 22h00 on Tuesday evening (8 June) due to delays in returning generating units. The embattled power utility said that these constraints have been exacerbated by the high winter demand brought about by the colder temperatures. Breakdowns currently total 15,498MW of capacity, while planned maintenance is 1,273MW of capacity. “The likelihood of load shedding is high for the rest of the week as the power system remains constrained and vulnerable and Eskom will communicate promptly should there be any changes. “These capacity constraints will continue for the foreseeable future and all South Africans are urged to reduce their use of electricity , particularly between 17h00 and 22h00, when the winter demand is highest,” it said.
