Eskom says it will suspend stage 2 load shedding on Friday afternoon to allow parliament time to pass a number of Appropriation bills. The embattled power utility said that the power cuts will be suspended between 12h00 and 17h00 to allow for the processing of the important legislation, which is being considered virtually. “Passing these bills is essential to keeping government operating, as without the relevant appropriations there will be no funding for key state functions, land enforcement and other essential services,” Eskom said. “The suspension of load shedding has been made possible by large industrial power consumers in South Africa who have agreed to reduce their consumption for this period to support the country.” Eskom said it will also be required to utilise emergency reserves during this period. It said that load shedding will also be extended to 22h00 on Sunday (6 June) to make up for the shortfall.
