Global financial group Credit Suisse has published its latest Global Wealth Report for 2021, showing that wealth in the country is becoming increasingly more concentrated at the top – with the country’s richest 1% holding more of the money than before. According to the group’s Wealth Databook, South Africa’s richest 1% currently hold about 41% of the country’s total wealth – estimated in 2021 at $763 billion. This is up significantly from the 35% recorded in 2019. This elite group of around 376,000 people – based on the adult population of 37.6 million – control around $311 billion of South Africa’s total wealth. Averaged out, this is $828,000 per person (R11.8 million). These figures are up from 2019 when the data was last recorded by Credit Suisse, where the average one-percenter was worth $750,000 at the time. Over the same period, total wealth in South Africa declined by around $35 billion. Breaking down Credit Suisse’s data further, it’s apparent that South Africa’s wealth is highly concentrated among the super-rich. Approximately 80% of total wealth is held by 10% of the adult population – but the biggest chunk of this is held by the top 1%. This can best be explained on a per-adult basis. According to Credit Suisse, wealth per adult in South Africa overall amounted to roughly $20,300 (R289,300) at the end of 2020. However, wealth per adult in the top 1% averages $828,000;  among the top 10%, it averages $162,000. Looking at the balance, the remaining 90% of the population controls only 20% of the country’s wealth and has a wealth per adult figure of only $4,500. This aligns with Credit Suisse’s data which records the median wealth per adult in South Africa at $4,523. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-500821" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Concetration-of-wealth-in-South-Africa-2020.png" alt="" width="752" height="1108" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Concetration-of-wealth-in-South-Africa-2020.png 752w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Concetration-of-wealth-in-South-Africa-2020-204x300.png 204w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Concetration-of-wealth-in-South-Africa-2020-695x1024.png 695w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> * Top 10% figures include the top 5% and top 1% numbers Even as wealth becomes more concentrated at the top, South Africa as a whole is getting poorer, Credit Suisse’s data shows. Globally, the broad category of wealth that represents the middle class is the $10,000 to $100,000 range. Only 20.2% of South Africans currently fall into this category, down significantly from 32.2% in 2019. At the same time, the number of South Africans worth less than $10,000 has increased to almost 76% of the adult population, from 65% before. Rich South Africans are also dropping out of the global 10%, with the country recording some of the biggest losses here. Credit Suisse recorded a loss of around 113,000 South Africans who dropped out of the global 10%, with only 1.1 million individuals forming part of the global elite, from 1.2 million before. Among the global top 1%, there are 54,000 South Africans who qualify, up from 51,000 in 2019. Read: South Africa continues to lose thousands of millionaires
