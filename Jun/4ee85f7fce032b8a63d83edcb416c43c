Parliament’s Joint Committee on Ethics and Members’ Interests has published the register of member’s interests for 2019. The register is published to ensure transparency, and to instil public trust and confidence in parliament, with members required to declare significant holdings in businesses, shares owned, as well as gifts received. Despite this push for transparency, the committee said that there were a number of members of parliament that did not disclose their interests before the required deadline. As a result, the committee said it has approved a report to both houses of parliament with recommendations for possible sanctions. Below, BusinessTech looked at some of South Africa’s most prominent politicians and what they declared. The complete register can be found below.
