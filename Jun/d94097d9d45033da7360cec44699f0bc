The number of new Covid-19 cases in South Africa climbed by 8,881 on Wednesday (June 9), new data from the National Institute of Communicable Diseases shows. The NICD, a division of the National Health Laboratory Service, pointed to a 16.5% positivity testing rate, while the total number of confirmed cases in the country moved to to 1,712,939. It has recorded 127 new deaths on Wednesday, taking the total to 57,310. Worryingly, the country’s most populous and productive province, Gauteng, has recorded the bulk of infections at 5,111 – or 58% of the new cases. “The increased number of tests and cases, and increased positivity are all evidence of the predicted third surge in Covid-19 cases,” the NICD said in a statement. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-497425" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Covid.png" alt="" width="942" height="765" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Covid.png 942w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Covid-300x244.png 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Covid-768x624.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> South Africa’s largest private medical insurer, Discovery warned its customers in Gauteng over the ‘alarming’ increase in the rate of infections in the province. “As a resident of Gauteng, you are currently at high risk of Covid-19 infection,” it said. “Our data shows an alarming increase in the rate of infections over the past few days,” Discovery said.
