The Western Cape provincial government has published a Request for Information (RFI) for its Municipal Energy Resilience (MER) Project. The RFI calls on all potential private and public sector organisations, including Western Cape municipalities, to provide information on renewable energy projects that would develop into new generation capacity in the Western Cape. “This is an important step forward in our MER Project which was launched last year to support municipalities to take advantage of the new energy regulations to generate, procure and sell their own power so that we can become more energy secure in the Western Cape,” the province said. It added that information submitted through the RFI will enable the Department of Economic Development and Tourism to consider options and develop the strategic approach to assist municipalities in the Western Cape to develop and/or procure new electricity generation capacity from all types of renewable energy generation and supply systems and technologies. This includes self-generation, battery energy storage systems, as well as hybrid generation and storage solutions. The provinces said that the MER Project is just one of the many ways to build energy resilience and buffer businesses and households from the impact of load shedding in the Western Cape. “The announcement by president Cyril Ramaphosa on Thursday (10 June) that Schedule 2 of the Electricity Regulation Act will be amended to increase the licensing threshold for embedded generation projects from 1 MW to 100 MW is a welcome move that will boost our initiatives to build energy resilience in the Western Cape. “To ensure we maintain momentum and move forward as quickly as possible, we need the Department of Mineral Resources and Energy to finalise Schedule 2 of the Electricity Regulation Act to provide further clarity and certainty to the market. “We remain in an energy crisis and large-scale private sector participation in energy generation, in partnership with government, will be key to addressing the current shortfall in the Western Cape.” Read: The good and bad news about Ramaphosa’s big private power announcement
