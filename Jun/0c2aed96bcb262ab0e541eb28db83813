Dr Hayley Haupt is a Partner at EY who is the Workforce Consulting Leader, appointed in 2020. Recognising the unique value that placing people at the centre of any organisation brings, underpins and is core to her work in this role. A former Partner in the EY Strategy business, Haupt played an instrumental part in growing the strategy and customer team. In her current and past roles, she has led transformative work at significant clients across the EMEIA region within several sectors including financial services, telecommunications, minerals and energy, logistics and fast-moving consumer goods. She has also played a role in developing and implementing the EY wavespace. Haupt first joined EY as a junior consultant. In 2015 she embarked on an independent consulting career, working with a diverse range of clients both locally and internationally before returning as a Partner in 2018. In this episode of Business Talk, Haupt talks through the process of returning to work in a post-Covid environment, and what that might look like. She says that reimagining work has taken on more than one form, namely fully returning to the office, versus remote working, versus a hybrid approach. Haupt walks Michael through the journey that organisations need to take their people along in this new working world, while offering guidance on what organisation leaders should be paying attention to for the rest of the year.
