Eskom has announced that South Africa will move to stage 4 load shedding at 14h00 on Wednesday (9 June). The extended power cuts will continue until 22h00, after which the country will revert to stage 2 as previously communicated, the power utility said. Eskom said that the move to higher load shedding was due to additional breakdowns at Medupi and Duvha power stations. It said that the higher stage was needed to station the remaining energy reserves and maintain stability on the national grid. These capacity constraints will continue for the foreseeable future, it said.  For those living in the major metros, the load shedding schedules are available here: City of Johannesburg
