Eskom has announced that stage 1 load shedding will be implemented between 17h00 and 22h00 on Monday evening (7 June). The embattled power utility that the power cuts are due to further breakdowns and delays in returning generating units at its Kusile, Kendal and Tutka power stations. This has been exacerbated by delays in returning a unit at other stations, it said. “The likelihood of load shedding is high for the rest of the week as the power system remains constrained and vulnerable and Eskom will communicate promptly should there be any changes. “These capacity constraints will continue for the foreseeable future and all South Africans are urged to reduce their use of electricity, particularly between 17h00 and 22h00, when the winter demand is the highest.”  For those living in the major metros, the load shedding schedules are available here: City of Johannesburg
