Statistics South Africa has published its latest consumer price index, showing that annual headline inflation has climbed above the 4.5% midpoint of the South African Reserve Bank’s monetary policy target range, accelerating to 5.2% in May from 4.4% in April. This is the highest reading since November 2018 when the rate was also 5.2%, the statistics body said on Wednesday (23 June). “The 5.2% annual change in May comes off a low base recorded in May 2020, when fuel prices were low. “Core inflation – this is CPI excluding food & non-alcoholic beverages, fuel and energy –  was 3.1% in May 2021, much lower than the headline rate. “This hints at the notable impact that fuel and food inflation has had on overall headline inflation levels.” <img class="aligncenter wp-image-500461 size-large" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Inflation-1024x688.jpg" alt="" width="840" height="564" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Inflation-1024x688.jpg 1024w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Inflation-300x202.jpg 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Inflation-768x516.jpg 768w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Inflation.jpg 1190w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> Some of the largest annual price increases (May 2020 vs May 2021) were recorded for the following goods and services: Sunflower oil: +30.3%
