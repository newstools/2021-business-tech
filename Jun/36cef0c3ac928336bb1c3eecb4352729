Devina Maharaj is program head: Investec Business Online and API Banking SA, having previously performed the role of head of digital South Africa.

She has a Master of Business Administration (MBA) from the University of the Witwatersrand, specialising in business and commerce. In this episode of Business Talk – Presented by EY, Maharaj talks through how Investec and the business world in general is managing the advances in the digital space – to essentially produce more value for clients. Maharaj says that the banking industry is still in the early stages of using AI and advanced analytics from a client perspective – predominantly because relationships forged between banks and clients have historically been human-based. The challenge for banks is how to merge the two in a way that provides warmth and attentiveness to customers, Maharaj says. She also speaks passionately about the skills transformation within the country’s workforce to ensure future job creation within the so called Fourth Industrial Revolution – or digital revolution.
