President Cyril Ramaphosa will hold a series of lockdown-related meetings on Tuesday (15 June) as the country considers additional restrictions as it battles a third wave of Covid-19 infections. State broadcaster the SABC said that Ramaphosa will first meet with the National Coronavirus Command Council where the Department of Health will make a presentation. Acting health minister Mmamoloko Kubayi-Ngubane has said that her department will make recommendations to increase restrictions as it seeks to motivate behavioural changes from South Africans. Ramaphosa is also expected to meet with the country’s provincial premiers as well as his cabinet. BusinessDay reported that the government’s Ministerial Advisory Committee on Covid-19 recommended a return to lockdown level 3, imposing similar restrictions to those implemented in December during the second wave of infections. This would mean an earlier evening curfew, a reduction on the size of public gatherings, and restrictions around the sale of alcohol. The Department of Basic Education said that it does not currently have any plans to close schools, as this would not help curb the spread of Covid-19. It added that a significant amount of teaching time had already been lost over the last 12 months. However, it said that the ultimate decision would be made with guidance from the Department of Health and Cabinet. South Africa reported 5,552 new cases of Covid-19 on Monday (14 June), taking the total reported to 1,752,630.
