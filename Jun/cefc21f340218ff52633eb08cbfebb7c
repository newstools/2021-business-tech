How can I get my articles published on BusinessTech? This is one of the most common questions the BusinessTech marketing team receives from companies. Fortunately, the answer is simple: sponsored articles. Sponsored articles are a content marketing product which provides the guaranteed publication of your articles on BusinessTech. Sponsored articles are published on the homepage of BusinessTech, and posted to BusinessTech’s Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn pages. All sponsored articles also receive a Partner tag, which makes them easy to find and identify for readers. You can take a look at the latest sponsored articles on BusinessTech here. BusinessTech has seen a big increase in the number of clients booking sponsored articles in past 12 months. This increase can be attributed to the excellent exposure companies receive, and the strong return on investment online content provides. Online advertising – particularly online articles – provides the best return on investment for your marketing budget. Nielsen’s Media ROI Benchmarks report for South Africa clearly illustrates this, stating that online advertising far outperforms cinema, print, TV, outdoor, and radio.
