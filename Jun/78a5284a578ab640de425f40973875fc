Acting health minister Mammoloko Kubayi-Ngubane has announced that government will open up Covid-19 vaccine registrations to more age groups nationally from next week. In a media briefing on Friday morning (25 June), Kubayi-Ngubane noted the important dates for all citizens between the ages of 50-59 : Registration will open on the electronic vaccination data system (EVDS) from 1 July.
Vaccinations for this age group are scheduled to begin on 15 July.
The EVDS can be accessed here. The minister said that as of Thursday, 2.5 million people have been vaccinated in South Africa with no deaths reported. She added that studies published this week show that there is clear evidence that vaccines provide high levels of protection to those who have been inoculated. South Africa has previously only allowed healthcare workers and people over the age of 60 to register for vaccinations. The government began its plan to vaccinate nearly half a million education staff this week. Kubayi-Ngubane said that the government was concerned about the number of people over 60 who have registered for a vaccine, which has continued to decrease. The minister said that this was particularly problematic as this age group is not at risk and yet the majority of people have not been vaccinated. She said that this was likely a result of high vaccine hesitancy, difficulties in accessing technology to register, and not being able to access vaccination centres. Kubayi-Ngubane said that the government was now finalising plans to bring vaccines directly to people.
