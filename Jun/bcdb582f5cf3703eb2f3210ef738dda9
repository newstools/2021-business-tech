Listed ICT company Datatec, says that its subsidiary, Logicalis Group has acquired Siticom, a 5G integrator based in Germany. Siticom has extensive skills in telecommunication and software defined networking architectures, IOT implementations and next generation Public and Private networks. It has developed strong relationships with many of the industry’s leading 5G technology providers including Nokia, AirSpan, Druid Software and MetaSwitch – recently acquired by Microsoft, it said in a statement. “The acquisition will give Logicalis a platform to establish a pan-European centre-of-expertise in developing advanced networking integration capabilities around 5G and evolving cloud orchestrated network interoperability. Logicalis also aims to expand these skill sets and
application knowledge across Datatec to complement its existing capabilities in markets such as Latin America and Asia,” it said. Established in 2010, Siticom now has a team of 130 employees delivering solutions to clients across Europe, including some of the world’s largest telecoms service providers, global financial market data providers and chemical park infrastructure operators. The company is headquartered in Frankfurt with additional offices in Cologne, Munich, Dresden and Bruchsal. Jens Montanana, Datatec’s chief executive officer, said: “We are beginning to see the IT landscape being increasingly driven by edge computing using many forms of wireless technology and the applications world moving increasingly to Cloud based infrastructure. “Tomorrow’s integrators will need to be able to knit these environments together and we believe the Siticom acquisition will give us a head start in the development of this knowledge with a view to transfer it across Datatec’s operations over time.” Read: Warning for taxpayers in South Africa
