FNB and the Department of Home Affairs (DHA) have extended Smart ID and passport collection points to KwaZulu-Natal. FNB customers in the province can now apply via the Department of Home Affairs’ online booking system and are be able to collect their Smart IDs and passports at FNB’s Cornubia branch. The Cornubia branch is the third FNB branch outside of Gauteng to offer the service. The service is now available across seven FNB branches, including Merchant Place (Gauteng), Centurion Lifestyle (Gauteng), Lynnwood (Gauteng), Greenpoint (Western Cape), Burgersfort (Limpopo), The Glen (Gauteng) and now Cornubia (KwaZulu-Natal). The booking process for ID and passport documents is facilitated through eChannel, a Home Affairs online booking portal that captures the applicant’s personal details. Once the application has been processed online, the customer can schedule a booking to visit one of the designated branches for fingerprint verification. The final stage is an SMS confirmation notifying the applicant that the document is ready for collection. “We remain committed to our partnership with the Department of Home Affairs and our ambition to expand this service nationally for all our customers to experience. We will be prioritising on rolling out this service to other provinces in the near future,” FNB said. Branches All of South Africa’s biggest banks – with the exception of Capitec – offer the E-Home Affairs service at a handful of their branches. Absa, FNB, Nedbank, and Standard Bank have had multiple branches supporting the service for several years. Discovery Bank and Investec Bank recently started participating in the programme with one branch each.
