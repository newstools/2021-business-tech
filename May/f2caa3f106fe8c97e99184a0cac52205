South Africa’s main stock gauge climbed for a fourth day, rising 0.5% by 09h46 in Johannesburg, as gains by iron ore producers, Richemont and banks countered weakness in gold and platinum producers and local market giant Naspers. The key index is poised for its longest streak of monthly advances for eight years. The Johannesburg benchmark tracked peers in Asia, which climbed after solid economic data and President Joe Biden’s federal spending plans spurred a Wall Street rally in cyclical shares. US data included a drop in jobless claims to a fresh pandemic low. Friday’s move took the weekly rise in the South African gauge to 1.5%, set to climb for the first week in three. With one trading session left after today for May, the FTSE/JSE Africa All Share Index is poised to rise for a seventh consecutive month, the longest such winning streak since the start of 2013. <img class="size-full wp-image-494285 aligncenter" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Ascent.jpg" alt="" width="814" height="457" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Ascent.jpg 814w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Ascent-300x168.jpg 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Ascent-768x431.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> Index heavyweight Richemont advanced for a seventh consecutive day, climbing 1.8% to a fresh record.
