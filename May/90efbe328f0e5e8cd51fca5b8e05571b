Cape Town mayor Dan Plato has approved a R3.9 billion expansion to the V&A Waterfront’s Canal District. The major infrastructure development will see a mixed-use development leading to the creation of at least 1,100 jobs during the construction phase, he said. The 10.5 hectare canal district includes expansion projects on either side of Dock Road and surrounding the existing Battery Park Development. Plato said that the district provides the first point of contact for visitors entering the V&A Waterfront from the city, creating a seamless link to Dock Road in the Waterfront from the CBD. He added that building height in certain parts of the extension east of Dock Road will be limited to 60 meters. “This is considered appropriate sensible planning to increase floor space, given its location in the City Foreshore area, where a number of the tallest buildings are located,” he said. “While the national lockdown had a major impact on cities across the world in 2020, the City of Cape Town is fully committed to doing everything we can to make sure our local economy bounces back even stronger than before. “With these major infrastructure developments and the huge job creation opportunities it delivers, it is clear that investors – both local and international – have confidence in doing business in our city and this will offer significant benefit to our residents.” Plato added that the development is not only beneficial for economic recovery and job creation, but it is also one of the key nodes within the city. “The V&A Waterfront is identified as a location that will remain an attractive destination for locals and international visitors for decades to come. “Significant and sustained investment by the private sector facilitated by the City of Cape Town, will ensure the long-term sustainability of Cape Town.  The concept is therefore, approved.” Read: Massive wind farm comes online in the Eastern Cape – with power for up to 120,000 households a year
