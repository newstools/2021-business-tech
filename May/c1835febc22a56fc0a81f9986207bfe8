The third season of Business Tech’s latest online talk show, Business Talk, will launch next month. The show is sponsored by EY and will feature conversations with South Africa’s leaders in the finance, business, and investment industries. The show is hosted by radio and TV personality Michael Avery, who is best known for being an anchor on Business Day TV and the Classic Business show on Classic FM.
