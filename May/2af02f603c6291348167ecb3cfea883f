President Cyril Ramaphosa has approved the salaries for a number of top government and parliamentary positions. In a gazette published on Friday (14 May), the president announced the salaries will take effect retroactively from 1 April 2020, with most senior officials receiving no increase. This aligns with recommendations made by the Independent Commission for the Remuneration of Public Office Bearers earlier this year. The recommendations are based on consultations with the minister of finance, the minister of Justice, the chief justice and Lower Courts Remuneration Committee, and the Department of Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs. “The commission has considered the fiscal condition of the country demonstrated in the previous financial years (2018/2019 and 2019/2020), the state’s wage bill and the impact of Public Office Bearers’ salary increment on the fiscus and general economic status of the country which has been negatively affected by the Covid-19 pandemic, affordability of the fiscus, relevant legislation and all other factors referred to above.” “As a result, the commission has recommended that there be no increment (0%) to the remuneration of all POBs’ categories.” In 2020, Ramaphosa, the deputy president, and members of cabinet took a 33% pay cut for three months as part of a contribution to South Africa’s fight against the coronavirus, donating the money to the country’s Solidarity Fund.
