The show is hosted by TV and radio personality Michael Avery – anchor of the Classic Business show on Classic FM and Business Day TV – who has interviewed the who’s who of the business world on Business Talk. This has included: Discovery Bank CEO – Hylton Kallner
ARC CEO – Johan van der Merwe
Standard Bank CEO – Sim Tshabalala
Sygnia CEO – Magda Wierzycka
EY for Africa CEO – Ajen Sita ‘The first two seasons of Business Talk with Michael Avery have been a huge success, and we have received great feedback from both viewers and the executives who took part,” said Broad Media MD Kevin Lancaster. “By hosting the country’s top executives on the show, who are expertly interviewed by Michael, and making their interviews available in a Netflix-type series we let our audience watch high-quality content when it suits them best.” Following the success of the first two seasons, Business Talk will be launching its third season soon – along with an SME-focussed series aimed at helping South African businesses take their operations to the next level.
