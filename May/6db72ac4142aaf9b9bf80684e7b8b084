The South African Municipal Workers’ Union (Samwu) says it will embark on indefinite protected strike action at Rand Water from 13 May 2021, which could impact water supply in a number of provinces. Rand Water is a bulk water utility entity and is responsible for water provision to municipalities and industries in Gauteng, North West, Free State and Mpumalanga provinces. “Rand Water has essentially pushed workers to the streets through their arrogance and changing the conditions of service of workers without any consultation,” the union said in statement on Tuesday. “This has been one of the most painful decisions that we have had to take as workers because we know the impact that this will have on residents. It is however important to note that before we are employees of Rand Water, we are community members and as such, we too want clean water running in our homes. ” As workers will be embarking on this strike action, Samwu said it cannot guarantee running water to residents and industries in Gauteng, North West, Free State and Mpumalanga provinces. “What we can all do is pray for rain as that will be the only guaranteed source of water during the strike action. We therefore urge our members and workers at Rand Water to prepare themselves to fight against the unilateral change of their conditions of employment.” Rand Water has previously said that a strike should not lead to water supply disruptions as the majority of employees are essential service workers.
