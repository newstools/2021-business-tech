Following a six month freeze on contributions for 2021, South Africa’s largest medical aid scheme, Discovery Health, has announced price changes which will come into effect from July. Discovery’s plans will increase at a rate of 5.9% across the board. Taking into account the 0% hike for the first six months of the year, this translates to an effective increase of 3% for the year. The medical scheme is the biggest in South Africa, with 1.34 million members recorded in 2020, and 2.8 million beneficiaries. This is four times bigger than any other open medical scheme, with Bonitas following at a distant second place with just under 340,000 members and 720,000 beneficiaries. 5 Biggest Open Medical Schemes (2020) <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-334389" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Discovery-logo2.png" alt="" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Discovery-logo2.png 640w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Discovery-logo2-300x202.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> Discovery Discovery will implement a 5.9% increase across all plans, effective 1 July 2021.
