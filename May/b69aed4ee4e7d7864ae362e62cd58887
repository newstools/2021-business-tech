Ether or ETH, the digital cryptocurrency of the Ethereum blockchain, has rocketed to an all-time high of over USD $3,500 this year – a gain of more than 1,200% in just 12 months. From humble beginnings, this cryptocurrency has crossed over into mainstream adoption, and even though many investors don’t entirely “get” how it works, they are finding reasons to add ETH to their portfolios. Sign up to Revix for free to invest in Ethereum From being worth just $250 just 12 months ago, ETH has grown so rapidly that it is now approaching the top 30 most valuable assets in the world. Ethereum’s total network value is now worth more than Bank of America, Paypal, Netflix, Coca Cola and even platinum’s total market value. However, even with all this growth Ethereum is still only worth 40% of Bitcoin’s total market value so there still may be a lot of upside ahead. So, why are investors so confident about the future of Ethereum? There are several reasons: There has been strong interest in the Ethereum blockchain network, which has led to an increased number of transactions performed per second. Due to this increased usage of the network, it has started to experience congestion, which has slowed it down, but also reaffirmed its popularity. Andreessen Horwitz, the venture capital firm that were early investors in Facebook, Instagram and Lyft, has bolstered confidence in ETH by leading a $25 million investment to help Ethereum scale up to support a greater number of transactions with a new scaling solution called Optimism. This growth will allow more transactions per second, decrease transaction fees, and result in a hugely improved experience for developers and users of the network. The main benefit of Optimism is its ability to support all of Ethereum’s smart contracts, which power and build decentralised applications. Ethereum made a gain of over 350% since the start of this year, which has attracted more interest from both developers and investors. This then fuels further development and interest in the blockchain. DeFi is short for ‘decentralised finance’, an umbrella term for a variety of financial applications in cryptocurrency geared toward disrupting financial intermediaries. It is an entirely new digital-only and fully automated financial system which exists completely outside the traditional financial system. DeFi has exploded over the last few years, growing to over $60bn today from just a few million 12 months ago. The sector enables anyone to lend, borrow, earn interest or take out insurance without a bank clerk rummaging through your income and expenses statements and demanding box-loads of documents. DeFi applications are open to everyone and rely on cryptography, blockchain and code in the form of applications (just like those you have on your mobile phone). Most DeFi projects are built on the Ethereum blockchain which is adding to ETH’s growth. The blockchain at this moment in time is kind of like the internet back in 1995. You could upload or download kilobytes, but not gigabytes per second. Today, Ethereum’s blockchain has the potential to take us from the internet of the 90s to the internet we know today, which lets us book car trips, watch VR movies, and much more. The applications that developers can build based on the Ethereum blockchain offer infinitive possibilities – imagine the possibility of instant payments without any fees, at any time. Or being able to track the exact geo-location of every middleman involved in the farming of the organic fruit you buy. Or payment being released to an eCommerce company, only once you receive the item you’ve ordered. Investors have gone through the gateway drug that is Bitcoin, and many are now betting on Ethereum as the next big winner in the smart contract crypto race. Perhaps you’re considering investing in Ethereum, or challenger cryptocurrencies like Polkadot, Cardano, VeChain and Tron. A good way to get in on the growth of these up-and-comers (without the guesswork) is to diversify your smart contract investment with a crypto Bundle from Revix. Sign up to Revix for free to invest in Ethereum Revix has created an ultra-simple investment platform that allows you to own a diversified basket, or as they call it, ‘Bundle,’ of the top cryptocurrencies for as little as R150. What sets it apart from traditional investments? There are no lock-up periods meaning you can sell out of your Bundle and withdraw your funds at any time. Sign up to Revix for free to invest in a Crypto Bundle Revix’s Bundles are ready-made investments that give you direct exposure to the underlying cryptocurrencies within each Bundle through one investment purchase. This way, you don’t have to guess which cryptocurrencies to buy into and don’t have to go through the hassle of managing all the individual cryptocurrencies yourself. Investing is as easy as signing up, verifying your account and buying a Bundle. The greatest component of Revix’s Bundles is their “invest and let it rest” functionality. Their Crypto Bundles automatically update your holdings every month so that you always stay up to date with the fast-paced crypto market. “Our Crypto Bundles let the most successful cryptocurrencies come to you, and this puts your whole investing experience on autopilot — making your money work harder for you”, explains Revix founder and CEO Sean Sanders. Revix offers 3 crypto Bundles on its platform, all of which provide investors exposure to the largest and most established cryptocurrencies. The Smart Contract Bundle provides equally-weighted exposure to the top 5 smart contract-focused cryptocurrencies like Ethereum, Cardano, Polkadot, EOS or Tron that enable smart contracts to be run on top of their blockchain. Smart Contracts use a blockchain to allow peer-to-peer transactions without the need for third party verification and enable developers to build applications on top of their blockchains, similar to how Apple builds apps on top of its OS operating system. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-488621" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Smart-contract-1-1024x633.png" alt="" width="640" height="396" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Smart-contract-1-1024x633.png 1024w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Smart-contract-1-300x185.png 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Smart-contract-1-768x475.png 768w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Smart-contract-1-1536x949.png 1536w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Smart-contract-1-2048x1266.png 2048w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Smart-contract-1-1200x742.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> The Top 10 Bundle is like the JSE Top 40 or S&P 500 for crypto and provides equally weighted exposure to the top 10 cryptocurrencies making up more than 85% of the crypto market. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-488619" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/top-10-1-1024x633.png" alt="" width="640" height="396" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/top-10-1-1024x633.png 1024w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/top-10-1-300x185.png 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/top-10-1-768x475.png 768w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/top-10-1-1536x949.png 1536w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/top-10-1-2048x1266.png 2048w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/top-10-1-1200x742.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> The Payment Bundle provides equally-weighted exposure to the top 5 payment focused cryptocurrencies looking to make payments cheaper, faster and more global.

Revix doesn’t charge monthly subscription fees but rather a simple 1.00% transaction fee for both buys and sells and a 0.17% per month rebalancing fee (which amounts to 2.04% a year only) on the total Bundle value held. So whether you want to invest in a slice of the entire crypto market or a specific niche sector in the crypto space, Revix has a low-cost and easy to use investment option to suit your needs.
