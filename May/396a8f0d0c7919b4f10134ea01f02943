Eskom has announced that stage 2 load shedding will be implemented from 16h00 on Monday (30 May)  until 05h00 on Tuesday morning. The embattled power utility said that there was a possibility of load shedding continuing throughout the week. “The load shedding has been cause by the higher demand as a result of the cold front setting in much earlier than expected, as well as high breakdowns of generation units. “The generation supply constraints will persist throughout the winter demand period, which increases the likelihood of load shedding.” Breakdowns currently total 14,500MW of capacity while another 2,300MW is unavailable due to planned maintenance. Eskom said that some generation units are set to return this evening which should help ease the strain. However, it warned of a high probability of load shedding for the rest of the week.
