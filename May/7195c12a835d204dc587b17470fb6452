South Africa’s largest medical aid scheme, Discovery Health, has announced its new fee schedules for 2021 which will come into effect from July. This follows a freeze on prices implemented during the Covid-19 pandemic last year. Discovery said that members had come under financial pressure because of the pandemic and national lockdowns, and decided to freeze contribution prices at 2020 levels for the first half of 2021. Come July, however, prices will be increasing – with the scheme promising to keep adjustments under CPI+2%. On Friday, the group announced that fees will be increasing by 5.9% across all plans. Given the 0% increase for the first half of the year, Discovery said this works out to a weighted increase of 3% for 2021. Weighted average increases across medical aids for 2021 were in line with recommendations from the Council for Medical Schemes (CMS) – including 3.9% and 4.6% for Momentum Health and Bonitas, respectively. The CMS called for companies to implement a freeze where possible, and if not possible, it recommended that increases be capped at 3.9%, in line with inflation. The CMS said that despite the cost savings accrued to most schemes due to a noticeable decrease in utilisation during the lockdown in 2020, there was a risk that the savings might be wiped out due to the Covid-19 peak in the country, as well as because of pent-up demand. “Accordingly, certain schemes may need to increase their contribution to mitigate against the risk of high-cost claims and subsequent reserves erosion,” it said at the time. “In cases where schemes are unable to freeze their contribution increase for 2021, CMS recommends that schemes should limit their increases to 3.9% in line with CPI.” Here are the full contribution changes (for the primary member).
