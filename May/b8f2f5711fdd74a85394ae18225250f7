Eskom will implement stage 2 load shedding on Sunday night from 17h00, lasting until Tuesday (18 May) at 22h00. The load shedding comes as a result of increased breakdowns, the power utility said. “Eskom regrets to inform the public that due to a loss of ten generating units at seven power stations during the past 24 hours, stage 2 load shedding will be implemented,” it said. The group saw the failure of three generation units at Tutuka due to a loss of air compressors; a unit at Majuba was forced to shut down while another unit tripped; and other units were lost due to boiler tube leaks, steam leaks and other trips. Eskom said these amounted to a loss of over 6,000MW over 24 hours – bringing total ‘unplanned loss of capacity’ to 16,118MW. The power utility urged the public to help it manage power demand by reducing consumption, while its teams work to restore capacity.
