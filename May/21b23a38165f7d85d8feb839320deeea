The board of JSE-listed technology company, Adapt IT Holdings has granted it’s chief executive officer, Sbu Shabalala leave of absence, at his request, for three months with effect from 10 May 2021 ‘to attend to personal matters’. Tiffany Dunsdon assumes the role of interim chief executive officer for the next three months. Dunsdon has served as executive director and chief commercial officer of Adapt IT. “In addition, Tony Vicente has been appointed as an Executive Director of Adapt IT. Tony was appointed as chief strategy officer of Adapt IT in September 2018 and will continue in this role with strong operational oversight,” it said. “Management continues its focus on business operations.” This comes a day after a Sunday Times report containing serious armed assault allegations against Shabalala by his estranged wife, Neo, MyBroadband reported. Shabalala is accused of ordering heavily armed men to beat up Neo Shabalala’s partner, who is now in critical condition in hospital. MyBroadband asked Sbu Shabalala for comment, but his spokesperson said he has been advised by his legal representatives to decline to make any statements at this stage. This, he said, is because of the divorce court proceedings and the inherently private nature of the matter. Shares in Adapt IT fell in excess of 13% on Monday (10 May 2020).
