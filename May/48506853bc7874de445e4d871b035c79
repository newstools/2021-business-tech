Sbu Shabalala, the chief executive officer of JSE-listed technology company Adapt IT, has detailed the reasons for his leave of absence, at his request, for three months with effect from 10 May 2021. His request to temporarily step aside comes after the Sunday Times reported serious armed assault allegations against Shabalala by his estranged wife, Neo. Shabalala is accused of ordering heavily armed men to attack Neo Shabalala’s partner, who is now in critical condition in hospital. MyBroadband asked Sbu Shabalala for comment, but his spokesperson said he has been advised by his legal representatives to decline to make any statements at this stage. Shabalala said the following in a statement on Tuesday (11 May), after shares in Adapt IT fell in excess of 13% on Monday (10 May). <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-489423" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/AdaptIT.png" alt="" width="753" height="413" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/AdaptIT.png 753w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/AdaptIT-300x165.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> Tiffany Dunsdon assumes the role of interim chief executive officer for the next three months.
