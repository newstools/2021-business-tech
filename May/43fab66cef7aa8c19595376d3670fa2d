• Conveniently Close to Cape Town’s Finest Landmarks Flyt Property Investment said it has partnered with Anuva Investments to provide investors with an advantageous tax-efficient structure that allows them to use their South African Revenue Service (SARS) tax refund towards their investment and then assists them in financing the balance. “Not only do you have the choice of purchasing a pre-approved unit priced from R895,000, but you can also qualify for a 100% tax deduction,” said Zane de Decker, chief executive of Flyt Property Investment. Investment into the Section 12J sector saw a major uptake leading up to the end of the tax season in February 2020 with the group reporting all their units across three developments being sold out. “Not only are you able to invest in property in a sought-after location for good value, but you can write off your tax investment amount against your tax liability for the 2021/2022 tax year,” said de Decker. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-493037 size-large" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Thibault-at-dusk-1024x684.jpeg" alt="" width="840" height="561" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Thibault-at-dusk-1024x684.jpeg 1024w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Thibault-at-dusk-300x200.jpeg 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Thibault-at-dusk-768x513.jpeg 768w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Thibault-at-dusk-1536x1025.jpeg 1536w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Thibault-at-dusk-1200x801.jpeg 1200w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Thibault-at-dusk.jpeg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> <img class="aligncenter wp-image-493039 size-large" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Thibault-4-1024x576.jpeg" alt="" width="840" height="473" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Thibault-4-1024x576.jpeg 1024w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Thibault-4-300x169.jpeg 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Thibault-4-768x432.jpeg 768w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Thibault-4-1536x864.jpeg 1536w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Thibault-4-1200x675.jpeg 1200w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Thibault-4.jpeg 1875w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-493079" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Thibault.png" alt="" width="1192" height="774" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Thibault.png 1192w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Thibault-300x195.png 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Thibault-1024x665.png 1024w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Thibault-768x499.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-493081" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Thibault1.png" alt="" width="1189" height="736" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Thibault1.png 1189w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Thibault1-300x186.png 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Thibault1-1024x634.png 1024w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Thibault1-768x475.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> Read: House prices in these wealthy South African suburbs are booming
