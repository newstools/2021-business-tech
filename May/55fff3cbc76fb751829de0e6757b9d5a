Justice and correctional services minister Ronald Lamola says that his department plans to offer a number of services online in an effort to improve accessibility. Presenting his departmental budget speech on Tuesday (25 May), Lamola said that the move online will improve service to citizens through greater flexibility, cost savings, faster delivery of justice service, less paper to waste and increased professionalism. Some of the key services will include: Maintenance services;
Protection orders;
The expungement of criminal records. Other services Lamola said that his department is also developing an online deceased estate system. This will be a convenient method that allows people who want to report deceased estates to do so in the comfort of their offices, homes or at any other remote location, he said. “This approach will drastically reduce queues and walk-in customers in the offices of the Masters or at the service points. The online deceased estate system will cut across the population as both rich and poor are affected by death.” This system will be implemented in the 2021/22 financial year. Lamola said that his department also plans to introduce online services for trusts this financial year. “This will streamline the trust registration process and assist in curbing fraud as applicants will be able to lodge their applications online. “This will assist with the workload of the trust sections as most information will be captured and scanned in by the applicants, freeing the masters’ hands to apply their minds thoroughly to the lodged documents and other clients.” Finally, Lamola said his department also plans to use technology for the serving of court processes like summons, which traditionally are served physically by the police and sheriffs. The minister said that this will help free up time to focus on service delivery priorities. Read: Government planning new basic income grant for South Africans aged 19 to 59
