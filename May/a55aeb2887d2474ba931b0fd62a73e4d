Responding in a recent written parliamentary Q&A in April, Cele said that the South African Police Service (SAPS) addresses major trends and hotspots areas using an overarching crime strategy, that includes the following five pillars: Intelligence gathering, analysis and coordination;
Proactive and high visibility approach;
Combat and reaction approach;
Reaction approach through detection and a focus on organised crime;
Communication and liaison. “The crime combatting strategy uses a geographic approach, informed by crime analysis to identify hotspots to allow targeted deployment, crime prevention and crime combatting actions. “The SAPS crime registrar identified the top 30 high crime rate police stations nationally, in respect of contact crime.” Cele said that the SAPS uses national crime combatting operations to address ‘prioritised crime threats’. He added that ‘Operation Vhutu Hawe’ is currently underway and focuses on hijackings, alongside other contact crimes. “During the month of February 2021, there was a deployment of 450 members to identified high crime stations in KZN, the Western Cape, Gauteng, Mpumalanga, and the Eastern Cape provinces, focusing on contact crimes. “In addition, senior SAPS officers have been assigned to visit and monitor these police stations,” he said.
