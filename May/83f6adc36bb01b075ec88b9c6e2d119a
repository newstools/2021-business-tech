Power utility Eskom says it will implement stage 1 load shedding on Wednesday evening (26 May), from 17h00 through to 22h00. This is due to a loss of generating capacity, the power utility said, along with delays in returning generating units to power. Eskom said its teams are working to return more generators to service as soon as possible. Should the generators not return as expected, further load shedding might be required during the week. The group has previously warned of increased demand peaks, and a higher chance of ongoing load shedding during the evening peak period (17h00 to 22h00) throughout the winter. South Africa was hit by the worst year of load shedding on record in 2020. Data published by the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) in March shows that 2020 saw 859 hours of load shedding. The most intensive load shedding was seen before the Covid-19 lockdown, which accounted for 63% of all load shedding seen in 2020. Most of this was stage 2 load shedding, the research body said.
