The Pretoria High Court of South Africa has awarded the National Prosecuting Authority’s investigating directorate restraint order valued at R1.4 billion against former Eskom executives and former Tubular Construction Projects contractors. The preservation order, granted in terms of the Prevention of Organised Crimes Act, was served and enforced on all the accused in Mpumalanga, Gauteng and Limpopo on Tuesday (4 May), the NPA said in a statement. Included in the order are: Former Eskom senior manager for Capital Contracts –  France Hlakudi;
Eskom’s former group executive for Group Capital  – Abram Masango;
Former Tubular Construction Projects chief executive – Antonio Trindade;
Former Tubular Holdings executive advisor – Michael Lomas;
Businessman – Maphoko Kgomoeswana;
Six companies owned by these individuals. “In addition, their spouses’ assets and their family trusts were included in the restraint order. The freezing order prohibits them from dealing in any manner with any of their realisable property,” the prosecuting authority said. Hlakudi, Trindade, Masango, Maphoko, and Lomas face charges of fraud and corruption. Kgomoeswana faces an additional charge of money laundering. The criminal matter is scheduled to appear back in court on 1 June 2021. Lomas, a resident of the United Kingdom, was arrested last month and appeared in court in London on the charges he is facing in South Africa. The process of his extradition back to the country started last month and the matter will return to the London Westminster Magistrates’ Court on 20 May 2021 for case management.
