Cryptocurrency has become one of the most popular ways to invest money both locally and globally. Cryptocurrency investment initially comprised of buying a cryptocurrency at a price you believed to be good value, before selling it when you thought you had maximised your profits. Now, however, there are many ways to invest in cryptocurrency – with arbitrage being the latest trend to take the industry by storm. Click here to find out more about crypto arbitrage. Cryptocurrency leverages pricing discrepancies between the markets that exist in different countries. Over the past few years, the average premium paid in South African Rand markets for Bitcoin has been 4.6% when compared to US Dollar markets. Therefore, by purchasing Bitcoin in US markets and then selling it in local markets, you can make a good profit.
This profit is far more reliable than buying a cryptocurrency and holding onto it in the hope that it rises in value.
