Nissan has opened orders for its new South Africa-made Navara bakkie, set to roll off the production line at Nissan’s Rosslyn plant next month. The group said that prices for the new Navara start from R311,000 for the 2.5 petrol XE SC, and R474,000 for the 2.5D diesel variant. Nissan said that the updated Navara single cab features 2.5 litre dual overhead camshafts with direct injection, turbocharged with a intercooler diesel engine producing 120kw of power and 403Nm torque. It will also feature a new chassis with revised mountings for less vibration, increased rear height, better shock absorber damping; and a new dual-rate five-link coil suspension. <img class="size-full wp-image-487921 aligncenter" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Navara-3.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="666" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Navara-3.jpg 1000w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Navara-3-300x200.jpg 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Navara-3-768x511.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> <img class="size-full wp-image-487923 aligncenter" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Navara-2.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="666" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Navara-2.jpg 1000w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Navara-2-300x200.jpg 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Navara-2-768x511.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> <img class="size-full wp-image-487925 aligncenter" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Navara-1.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="666" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Navara-1.jpg 1000w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Navara-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Navara-1-768x511.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> Nissan said that severity-testing of South African roads has been accounted for when fine-tuning the suspension grade. It said that the new Navara’s payload is also 100kg bigger. An added step to the rear bumper for the SE Plus and LE grades, and an easy-lift tailgate and a torsion bar on all DC derivatives, also makes loading and unloading easier. The Navara line-up also features additional safety technology through Nissan Intelligent Mobility (NIM), and offers a host of cabin features including an 8- inch touch screen with NissanConnect, Android Auto, and Apple CarPlay. <img class="size-full wp-image-487927 aligncenter" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Navara-4.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="666" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Navara-4.jpg 1000w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Navara-4-300x200.jpg 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Navara-4-768x511.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> <img class="size-full wp-image-487929 aligncenter" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Nissan-5.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="666" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Nissan-5.jpg 1000w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Nissan-5-300x200.jpg 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Nissan-5-768x511.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> Nissan said that the retail price of the Navara includes a six-year/90,000 km service plan and six-year/150,000 km warranty.
