BusinessTech is the largest business news website in South Africa, and home to the country’s top business decision makers. These business decision makers include CEOs, Directors, Business Owners, and Senior Managers – making BusinessTech the ideal platform for B2B marketing. “This high-end group of people is the exact target audience South African businesses want to reach,” said BusinessTech MD Kevin Lancaster. “BusinessTech’s effective range of advertising options lets these businesses reach their ideal audience in a cost-effective and targeted manner.” BusinessTech’s value proposition is further enhanced by the fact that it is an online-first platform. With more companies shifting their operations online permanently, and more people working through digital channels, online news sites such as BusinessTech have seen a big growth in their readerships and engagement rates. South Africans now start their morning by reading news online, and constantly check social media and video channels throughout the day. This makes online channels like BusinessTech’s news website – and its associated Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Instagram, and YouTube pages – the perfect place for companies to reach their target market. Additionally, online advertising provides the best return on investment when compared to other advertising channels – making it an easy decision for companies to allocate marketing spend to platforms such as BusinessTech.
