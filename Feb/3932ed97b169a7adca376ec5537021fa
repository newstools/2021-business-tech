Specialist professional recruitment firm Robert Walters has published its annual salary survey for 2021. Jason Grundy,  managing director of Robert Walters for the Middle East & Africa, said that the pandemic and global crisis naturally resulted in an immediate downturn in hiring, with a shift from functions promoting growth and expansion, towards functions supporting stability, cash flow, and essential services. “Cost-saving measures, reallocation of current resources and critical hires, which promote the streamlining of business operations have been evident,” he said. “We anticipate businesses to continue to be conservative when it comes to salary increases. Overall salaries are to remain static and in certain areas, reduced.” Grundy added that professionals looking to increase their earnings most likely would need to seek new opportunities, however, new starters should still expect conservative salary increases when moving roles. “In addition, we expect reduced bonuses in line with company performance and their need to maintain a strong cash position. “We foresee organisations taking a flexible approach to benefits packages as a way of retaining top talent. These benefits would likely include measures to support the new operating model, such as work from home.” Legal jobs in South Africa The most in-demand jobs in South Africa’s legal sector include associates specialising in mergers and acquisitions, banking and finance and legal advisors.
