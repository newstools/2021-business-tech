Gijima’s acquisition of T-system South Africa (TSSA) has been approved by the Competition Commission. The approval will position Gijima as the largest Black-owned ICT company in Southern Africa, with about 500 new employees joining Gijima in March. In October 2020, Gijima and TSSA announced that Gijima had acquired the T-system South African business. TSSA, is owned by T-Systems International, an IT services arm of German-based Deutsche Telekom. The company has been operating in South Africa for over 20 years, providing ICT networks, applications and solutions to a number of industries. Although the announcement was made in October, after a long period of negotiations, the acquisition was still subject to approval from the Competition Commission. The Competition Commission approved the acquisition earlier this week, 2 February 2021. The deal provides Gijima access to international IP, TSSA’s global Cybersecurity Security Operations Centre (SOC), certificates, expertise and best practices. T- Systems business includes a Tier 3 Data Center. These services will now be coupled with Gijima’s existing cloud computing and digitalization offerings, the group said.
