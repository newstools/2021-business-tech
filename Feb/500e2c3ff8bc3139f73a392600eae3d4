Hylton Kallner is the chief executive officer of Discovery Bank, having taken over the reins from Barry Hore at the beginning of the year. Kallner has been a part of the Discovery business for nearly 25 years, having previously served as chief executive officer of Discovery Life, and chief marketing officer before that. His understanding of Discovery’s shared-value business model, along with his extensive experience at Discovery Group, has positioned him well to drive growth for Discovery Bank. Kallner obtained a Bachelor of Economic Science (BEconSc) from the University of the Witwatersrand. In this episode of Business Talk with Michael Avery, Kallner talks through the next phase of growth for the bank, which has seen a solid trajectory in recent months with 531,000 accounts and R5 billion in retail deposits. Towards the end of 2020, Discovery Bank launched several digital products including Virtual Card and Discovery Pay, which enables clients to make payments to other Discovery clients in their mobile contact list. Kallner says that the technology is working well, with thousands of clients making use of the various new products. Kallner says that in 2021, the bank will focus on educating the market on shared-value banking, which includes a soon-to-be-launched marketing campaign. The aim of shared-value banking is to reward customer’s financial behaviour. Clients create value as they manage their money well, through better interest rates, discounts at retailers, and other similar reward offerings. The full interview is embedded below.
