Teraco, Africa’s largest interconnection hub and vendor-neutral data centre provider, says it has finalised a new R2.5 billion loan financing transaction which will be used in the construction of a new 38-megawatt hyperscale data centre in Johannesburg. The facility is called JB4 and will be the largest data centre in Africa once it is built. Phase one of the JB4 data centre is scheduled to be completed in Q1 2022 and the entire data centre will require a total investment of $250 million (R4 billion) to complete, Teraco CEO Jan Hnizdo told MyBroadband. The timeline for the construction of the second phase will be informed by Teraco’s operations and demand for cloud and hosting services. Hnizdo said that Teraco is poised for major growth as demand for cloud services continues to climb. The new transaction cements Teraco’s commitment to continuing investment in the region’s digital infrastructure and expanding Africa’s largest data centre platform, the group said. The funding transaction, led by Absa, includes several large institutions that have joined the lending group, with a view to creating long term partnerships that will support Teraco’s future expansion plans. Teraco JB4 data centre details Teraco’s JB4 data centre is the seventh data centre developed by the company and takes critical power load capacity at the company’s facilities up to over 110MW. This includes the Isando Campus JB1/JB3 (39MW), Bredell JB2 (13MW), Rondebosch Cape Town CT1 (3MW), Brackenfell Cape Town CT2 (18MW) and Durban (1MW). The JB4 data centre will comprise a whopping 50,000m2 of building structure serviced by 80MW of utility power supply, and it will boast 16,000m2 of hall space with 38MW of critical power load when completed. It will be built in two phases across six hectares of land, with phase 1 delivering half of the overall hall space and critical power load. Read: Teraco begins work on Africa’s largest data centre
