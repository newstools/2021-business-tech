Sita was made a partner in 1999 and subsequently held several leadership positions including head of entrepreneurial services, lead audit partner on Telkom and head of assurance, before becoming managing partner and chief executive officer of EY Africa on 1 October 2010. “My other passion lies in the transformation of the accounting and auditing profession. This is demonstrated through my role as chairman of the Thuthuka Education Upliftment Fund which is the body driving the race and gender transformation of the accounting profession in South Africa,” he said. Sita received a CA from the South African Institute of Chartered Accountants (SAICA), having obtained a BAcc, Accounting from the University of Witwatersrand. In this episode of Business Talk with Michael Avery, Sita talks about the challenges of managing a workforce during the Covid-19 pandemic. He says that EY noticed high levels of productivity over lockdown, with staffers working form home. According to Sita, EY has seen a high adoption rate of online courses offered to employees over the past year, as people looked to improve their credentials over lockdown. He says that the next challenge for all businesses is trying to understand what the recovery looks like – “it’s not going to be anything like how it was pre-Covid,” he says. EY expects ‘work-from-anywhere’ to become more mainstream in the future, meaning a change in how business operates – most notably smaller space requirements and reduced real estate costs.
