Multichoice has announced price increases for its DStv packages for 2021. The group’s Premium package has seen a marginal increase of R10, taking it to R829 per month. Similar R10 price increases are being introduced for the DStv Compact and DStv Compact Plus packages, with DStv Family seeing a R16 increase. The price to rent a BoxOffice movie will increase to R40, up from the previous R35. The Access Fee has also increased by a R5 to an amount to R105. These updated fees, will take effect from 1 April 2021. The DStv price hikes come as South African consumers find themselves under economic pressure. When it comes time to cut costs and save money, entertainment packages are some of the first to go. MultiChoice COO Simon Camerer said while they are increasing prices across the board, they have been able to keep them in check. “On a weighted average basis, we are looking at about a 2.4% increase across the base,” said Camerer. He said they have tried to keep it under inflation, which they have done for the last number of years. “We still have to pay most of our content costs in dollars and we have to try and manage the exchange rate as best we can,” he said.
