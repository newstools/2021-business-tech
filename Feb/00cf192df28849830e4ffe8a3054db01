The Gatsby mansion on Houghton Ridge in Johannesburg is back on the market – at a 45% discount to its original asking price two years ago. Now priced at R64.8 million, the super-luxury property was designed and furnished by Pellerade Design House, a company known for creating homes for African royalty and other uber-wealthy clients. Gatsby offers views over the northern suburbs towards Pretoria and 2,000sqm of ultra-luxury living space spread over four floors, as well as extensive conference and boardroom facilities that are separate from the main house. It incorporates accommodation for au pairs and assistants. <img class="size-full wp-image-465862 aligncenter" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Gatsby-house.png" alt="" width="848" height="547" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Gatsby-house.png 848w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Gatsby-house-300x194.png 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Gatsby-house-768x495.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> <img class="size-full wp-image-465838 aligncenter" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Gatsby-2.png" alt="" width="843" height="553" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Gatsby-2.png 843w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Gatsby-2-300x197.png 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Gatsby-2-768x504.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> <img class="size-full wp-image-465846 aligncenter" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Gatsby-bed.png" alt="" width="836" height="557" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Gatsby-bed.png 836w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Gatsby-bed-300x200.png 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Gatsby-bed-768x512.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> The property boasts its own spa as well as a library, gymnasium, heated indoor pool, salt-water outdoor training pool.
