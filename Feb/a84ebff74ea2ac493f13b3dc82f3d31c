Construction recently completed on the 35 Lower Long building, an 86-metre glass-clad office tower, built in Cape Town’s city centre. The building, developed by Abland Property Developers and designed by dhk Architects, has a number of dynamic, glazed planes that extend over the office and parking levels. The two main corners of the building are ‘chamfered’ (cut away) towards the roofline and soar upwards, forming a wing-like effect, giving it a distinct look and setting it apart on the Cape Town city skyline, dhk said. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-465564 size-full" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Lower-1.jpg" alt="" width="1080" height="1620" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Lower-1.jpg 1080w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Lower-1-200x300.jpg 200w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Lower-1-683x1024.jpg 683w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Lower-1-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Lower-1-1024x1536.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> <img class="size-full wp-image-465562 aligncenter" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Lower-2.jpg" alt="" width="1080" height="1620" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Lower-2.jpg 1080w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Lower-2-200x300.jpg 200w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Lower-2-683x1024.jpg 683w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Lower-2-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Lower-2-1024x1536.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> The site is located in Roggebaai, Cape Town’s growing financial and hospitality precinct, and was previously occupied by an eight-storey 1980s office building which prior to that was part of the now-demolished Long Street Power Station site. The building has an estimated cost of R500 million, with construction slightly disrupted by the Covid-19 pandemic. As it is now one of the tallest buildings in the city, it also offers views across much of Cape Town. “Internally, the building offers expansive 360-degree views over the city, ocean and mountains,” dhk Architects said.  “The glazed façade allows for floor-to-ceiling unencumbered vistas enhanced by glazing with mullions at 2.4-metre-wide centres.” <img class="size-full wp-image-465560 aligncenter" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Lower-3.jpg" alt="" width="1620" height="1080" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Lower-3.jpg 1620w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Lower-3-300x200.jpg 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Lower-3-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Lower-3-768x512.jpg 768w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Lower-3-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Lower-3-1200x800.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> <img class="size-full wp-image-465566 aligncenter" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Lower-4.jpg" alt="" width="1080" height="1620" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Lower-4.jpg 1080w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Lower-4-200x300.jpg 200w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Lower-4-683x1024.jpg 683w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Lower-4-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Lower-4-1024x1536.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> The building also has a 4-star GBCSA Design rating, a detailed environmental performance modelling study was undertaken. “This required a high-performance double-glazed specification with increased internal cill height raised to desk height – to reduce both solar gain and radiant heat which significantly lowered HVAC requirements. “Other environmental considerations included building efficiency, choice of materials, energy-efficient lighting and services, lower parking ratio encouraging the use of public transport, as well as showers and bicycle parking facilities,” dhk Architects said.
