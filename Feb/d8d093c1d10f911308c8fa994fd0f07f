Trade Union Solidarity has announced the completion of its new Sol-Tech Occupational Training College campus in Gauteng. Funded entirely by community investments, the campus is part of a R300 million project which consists of the education campus and a student residential complex, development of which is currently underway. The campus as a stand-alone development was a few million below R200 million in total, the trade union said. It added that the construction period from ground breaking to occupation by Sol-Tech was approximately 15 months. Solidarity said that the campus is now the new home of Sol-Tech, and facilities previously used were leased and terminated with the move to the new campus. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-467774 size-large" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Campus-2-1024x683.jpg" alt="" width="840" height="560" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Campus-2-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Campus-2-300x200.jpg 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Campus-2-768x512.jpg 768w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Campus-2-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Campus-2-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Campus-2-1200x800.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> <img class="aligncenter wp-image-467776 size-large" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Campus-1-1024x683.jpg" alt="" width="840" height="560" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Campus-1-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Campus-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Campus-1-768x512.jpg 768w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Campus-1-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Campus-1-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Campus-1-1200x800.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> <img class="aligncenter wp-image-467788 size-large" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Campus-6-1024x683.jpg" alt="" width="840" height="560" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Campus-6-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Campus-6-300x200.jpg 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Campus-6-768x512.jpg 768w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Campus-6-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Campus-6-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Campus-6-1200x800.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> Solidarity said that its next major project is the construction of the Akademia campus where education will be offered through Afrikaans as the medium of instruction.
