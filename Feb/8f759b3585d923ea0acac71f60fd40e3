Basic Education minister Angie Motshekga will announce the 2020 national examination results on Monday (22 February 2021). The Grade 12 cohort of 2020 faced a number of challenges in preparing for their matric exams, chief amongst these being the Covid-19 lockdown which drastically cut down on available teaching and learning time. Students also faced the possibility of having to re-write their maths and science papers after the exams leaked early, giving rise to security concerns. The matric examinations started on 5 November 2020 and the final papers were written on 15 December 2020. Marking of the 2020 matric exams started on 4 January 2021 and involved 45,000 matric exam markers, 216 question papers, and over 10 million scripts. Umalusi, the quality council for general and further education and training, approved the release of the matric results on 15 February 2021. Individual results will be available on Tuesday morning (23 February).
