Transport director-general Alec Moemi has published a number of gazettes which detail the country’s new toll tariffs for 2021. The gazettes outline the fees for key toll roads across the country which are set to come into effect at 00h00 on 1 March. Moemi has also published the fees schedule for the controversial Gauteng Freeway Improvement Project (GFIP) – also known as e-tolls. E-tolls have met with resistance from road users since inception in 2013, leading to non-payment by many, and calls to scrap the system altogether. In October 2020, Transport minister Fikile Mbalula said that his department is being impeded from rolling out new road infrastructure projects because of a lack of resolution around e-tolls. The minister said that president Cyril Ramaphosa’s cabinet is set to finalise a new funding model for the project after receiving proposals from his department. Mbalula admitted that he thought the issue would have been resolved by now, but that the process has been impacted by the Covid-19 pandemic. You can find a breakdown of the new toll tariffs below.
