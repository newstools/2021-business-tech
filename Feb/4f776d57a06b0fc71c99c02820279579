Drivers carrying large amounts of cash are also being targeted,” it said. Tracker data indicates that: Most vehicles are reported hijacked or stolen at the end of the week;
Most hijackings are reported on Wednesday through to Friday and between the hours of 16h00 and 20h00;
Theft is mainly reported on Wednesday through to Saturday and between the hours of 11h00 and 15h00. Tracker’s data shows that Gauteng still experiences the most vehicle crime, with hijacking prevalent in Johannesburg and theft mainly occurring in Pretoria. This is followed by KwaZulu-Natal with Durban in the top spot for both hijacking and theft, and the Western Cape with hijacking mainly occurring in Mitchells Plain and theft in Cape Town.
