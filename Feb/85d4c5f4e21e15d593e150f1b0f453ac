Eskom has announced that it will introduce stage 2 load shedding overnight starting at 22h00 on Tuesday evening (9 February). The embattled power utility said that the power cuts will continue until 05h00 on Wednesday morning (10 February). Eskom said that the load shedding was necessary to replenish the emergency generation reserves and to maximise the capacity available during daytime hours. It said that its  power generation system is still severely constrained due to high generation unit breakdowns over the past two days, as well as the delayed return of some units which were down due to planned maintenance. It added that the risk of load shedding remains elevated over this period.  For those living in the major metros, they can check to see when they will be affected: City of Johannesburg
