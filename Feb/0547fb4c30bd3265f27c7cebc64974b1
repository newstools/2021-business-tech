The Presidency has released a new report on the implementation of the ‘presidential employment stimulus’, which aimed to create or support 800,000 jobs in South Africa within the current financial year. Announced as part of the country’s coronavirus economic recovery plan in October, president Cyril Ramaphosa said that the stimulus is designed to respond to the rise in unemployment caused by the coronavirus pandemic. “The Presidential Employment Stimulus supports a range of opportunities through the expansion of public employment as well as job retention in vulnerable sectors. In addition to employment opportunities, the stimulus provides crucial support for livelihoods in the creative sector, the agricultural sector and the early childhood development sector,” the presidency said. “Eleven national departments and all nine provinces are responsible for the implementation of programmes supported through the employment stimulus.” The latest report shows that more than 600,000 ‘opportunities’ have been supported to date or are currently open for recruitment/applications. The progress and job opportunities are outlined in more detail below. Read: Moody’s sends downgrade warning to South Africa
