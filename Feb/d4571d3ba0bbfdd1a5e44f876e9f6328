Employment and Labour minister Thulas Nxesi has published a new gazette outlining the sectoral determinations for workers in South Africa’s wholesale and retail sectors. The changes take effect from 1 March 2021 alongside recent changes to South Africa’s minimum wage. These wages establish the minimum baseline across the sector and workers can earn significantly more based on their position and the company that they work for. Workers are also paid in accordance with what part of South Africa they are based in. While supermarkets remain some of the largest employers in South Africa, there is a growing gap between the highest and lowest-paid workers. The below table shows the monthly wages for workers in both Area A and Area B: Nxesi also published the new minimum wage for South Africa. In a gazette published on Monday evening (8 February), the minister said that the national minimum wage is now R21.69 for each ordinary hour. This change will take effect from 1 March 2021. The gazette also provides exceptions for a number of worker groups Farmworkers are entitled to a minimum wage of R21.69 per hour;
Domestic workers are entitled to a minimum wage of R19.09 per hour;
Workers employed on an expanded public works programme are entitled to a minimum wage of R11.93 per hour. The National Minimum Wage Act was first proclaimed in 2018, setting a historic precedent in the protection of low-earning (vulnerable) workers in South Africa and provided a platform for reducing inequality and huge disparities in income in the national labour market.
