Eskom has announced that it will introduce stage 2 load shedding starting at 12h00 on Friday afternoon (5 February). The embattled power utility said that the power cuts will continue until 23h00 on Sunday evening (7 February). Eskom said that the load shedding has been exacerbated by the shutdown of generating units at its Medupi power station. This was caused by an inability to get coal into the units due to heavy rains in the region. The power utility said that it currently has 4,114 MW in outages due to planned maintenance with a further 15,739 MW lost due to unplanned outages.
