Eskom has announced that stage 3 load shedding will be implemented from 13h00 on Wednesday afternoon (10 February). The embattled power utility said that the power cuts will continue until 06h00 on Thursday morning following the loss of generation units and to replenish emergency generation reserves. It said that its power generation system is still severely constrained due to high generation unit breakdowns over the past three days. This has been compounded by power units which have failed to return to usage after planned maintenance. It added that there is a high probability of power cuts continuing on Thursday.
