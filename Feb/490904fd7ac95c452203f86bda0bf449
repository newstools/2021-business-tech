Transport minister Fikile Mbalula has outlined a number of initiatives which are currently being worked on by his department, including a plan to scrap over 63,000 taxis and finalise the issue of e-tolls. Speaking in the debate on the State of the Nation Address in parliament on Wednesday (18 February), Mbalula said that his department is also prioritising a ‘road to rail shift’. “In giving traction to the road to rail shift, we are putting in place long-term interventions that will introduce rail-reform, thereby making rail more effective, efficient, and competitive both in respect of freight and passenger transport.”
